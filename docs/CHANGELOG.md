# CHANGELOG

## [2.0.8] — 2026-04-24 — Click-blocked feedback toast (locked/protected silent fail)

User-reported #1 usability complaint:
> "сложно редактировать и натыкаюсь постоянно на нередактируемые
> элементы"

When the user clicked on the preview iframe and the click resolved
to nothing (target was locked or protected from selection),
bridge-script's `if (!selection?.selectedEl) return;` silently
short-circuited. The cursor stayed normal, no toast appeared, the
selection didn't change — the editor felt broken. The user had no
way to know WHY their click did nothing.

### Added

**Bridge → shell `click-blocked` message** — when click resolves to
nothing, bridge-script walks the original event target's ancestry
and detects whether a `[data-editor-locked="true"]` or
`[data-editor-protected="true"]` ancestor blocked the selection.
Posts `click-blocked` with `{ reason, nodeId }` to the shell.

**Shell receiver `applyClickBlockedFromBridge(payload)`** —
contextual toast per reason:
- `locked` → "Слой заблокирован — Снимите блок (🔒 в инспекторе
  или панели слоёв) и кликните снова."
- `protected` → "Защищённый блок — Этот элемент помечен как
  защищённый — редактирование запрещено в этой презентации."
- unknown → "Клик не выбрал элемент — Цель клика не доступна для
  выделения. Попробуйте Alt+клик чтобы выбрать предка."

**1.5 s throttle per `(reason, nodeId)` pair** — rapid double-
clicks don't stack toasts. Identical payload within 1.5 s is
swallowed.

**Bridge schema entry** — `BRIDGE_MESSAGES.CLICK_BLOCKED` registered
in `bridge-schema.js` and added to `SCHEMA_FREE_TYPES` so message
validation accepts it.

### Tests

`tests/playwright/specs/click-blocked-feedback.spec.js` (new) —
6 specs:
1. `applyClickBlockedFromBridge` is exposed on window
2. `locked` reason → "Снимите блок" toast visible
3. `protected` reason → "Защищённый блок" toast visible
4. Unknown reason → fallback toast with "Цель клика не доступна"
5. Empty reason is a no-op (no toast spawned)
6. Identical (reason, nodeId) within 1.5 s is throttled

Added to `npm run test:gate-a` so the gate is canonical.

### Non-breaking

- New message type only flows iframe → shell. No mutation contract
  changes. Existing decks render identically.
- Throttle state lives on `state.__clickBlockedThrottle` (separate
  bag) so it survives selection changes without polluting the main
  state shape.

### Files

- `editor/src/bridge-script.js` — click handler detects locked /
  protected ancestor and posts `click-blocked`.
- `editor/src/bridge.js` — switch case routes `click-blocked` to
  the receiver.
- `editor/src/feedback.js` — `applyClickBlockedFromBridge`
  implementation + window export.
- `editor/src/bridge-schema.js` — `CLICK_BLOCKED` registered as
  schema-free message.
- `editor/src/globals.d.ts` — typed declaration for the receiver.
- `tests/playwright/specs/click-blocked-feedback.spec.js` — new spec.
- `package.json` — `test:gate-a` script + `version` 2.0.8.

### Honest note

The user's complaint was about `cursor: not-allowed` showing on
locked elements (added in v2.0.7) being too quiet — you only
notice it AFTER the click. The toast in v2.0.8 fires AT the click,
so it can't be missed. Together the cursor + toast form a clear
"here is the gate, here is how to lift it" pair.

---

## [2.0.7] — 2026-04-24 — Selection + hover rings beefed up for busy decks

User asked for "relevant and purposeful highlights" across the whole
product. First sweep: the in-iframe selection / hover rings. The
prior values (2px solid 92% alpha + 8% bg tint, 1px dashed 50% alpha)
disappeared on photo backgrounds, dark hero sections, and slides
with strong gradients. Users could not tell what was selected on
half the real-world decks.

### Improved

**Selected ring** — outline alpha 0.92 → 0.96, background tint
0.08 → 0.10, plus a new 4px outer halo (box-shadow @ 0.18 alpha)
that creates contrast even when the inner outline fights with the
element's own colour. 120ms transitions on outline / shadow /
background so selection changes feel smooth instead of snapping.

**Hover ring** — width 1px → 1.5px, alpha 0.5 → 0.7, plus a 2px
softer halo so the hover is unmistakable on dark backgrounds. The
hover ring stays visually lighter than the selected ring so the
hierarchy is preserved.

**Ghost (drop preview) ring** — same beef-up: solid border at 0.7
alpha + 4px halo at 0.14 alpha so drag-target previews are visible
across themes.

**Locked-element cursor** — `cursor: not-allowed` on every
`[data-editor-locked="true"]`. Previously a click on a locked
element silently fell through to the parent, which felt like a
broken hit-test ("I clicked but nothing happened"). The cursor
change makes the gating obvious. (A dedicated locked-hover ring
can't fire because the resolver filters locked nodes from the
candidate set — the cursor is the affordance.)

### Non-breaking

- Capability unchanged — only visual treatments adjusted.
- All four rules use the existing `data-editor-*` attributes; no
  new state machinery.
- Pure additive transitions, so reduced-motion users still see
  instant changes (browser respects `prefers-reduced-motion`).

### Files

- `editor/src/bridge-script.js` — selection / hover / ghost / locked
  CSS templated into the iframe `<style>` element.
- `tests/playwright/specs/inspector-validators-badges.spec.js` —
  opacity test flake hardened (see below).

### Test flakes hardened (same tag)

Three `Inspector validators (v1.5.0)` tests intermittently failed on
Windows + Playwright 1.58 with `Expected "X", Received ""`:
- `Opacity input clamps via validator` — `<input type="number">`
- `Valid CSS length applies` — `<input type="text">` width
- `Bad CSS length in widthInput surfaces a toast and skips applyStyle`
  — same text input

Root cause: `fill(...)` followed by `press("Tab")` did not reliably
fire the `change` event handler that runs the validator. The handler
never reached `applyStyle(...)` and modelDoc was never mutated.
Switched all three tests to direct `el.value = "X";
el.dispatchEvent(new Event("change", { bubbles: true }))` via
`page.evaluate` — this bypasses the focus-race that fill+Tab
introduces. All three are now stable across multiple repeats (was
0/3 even with retries previously).

### Honest note

The hardcoded blue (rgb 38,103,255) is intentional: bridge-script
runs INSIDE the iframe and cannot read shell tokens. A future tag
will pipe the shell accent through the bridge so the ring follows
the user's accent setting; for v2.0.7 the goal was visibility, not
themability.

The opacity-test flake was discovered while validating the visual
changes; folding the fix into the same tag because the spec was
blocking gate-a and shipping it in a separate tag would have
created a window where main was red. The fix is purely a test
robustness improvement — no production code involved.

---

## [2.0.6] — 2026-04-24 — Layer panel declutter (remove inline z-input + Текущий chip)

User screenshot follow-up on the v2.0.5 layer panel fixes. The row
still showed an inline `z: auto` text input next to the eye + lock
icons on the active row, and a "Текущий" chip that duplicated the
`.is-active` row highlight. Both read as noise rather than
affordance.

### Removed

**Inline `.layer-z-field` + `.layer-z-input`** — a holdover from
pre-inspector-redesign days when row-level z-editing was the only
way to reach it. It is now redundant with three existing paths:
1. Inspector → "Расположение" → z-index (precise edit, every element).
2. `Ctrl+Shift+↑/↓` — bring-to-front / send-to-back shortcuts.
3. "Упорядочить стек" button — normalize whole slide.
4. Drag handle (grip) — visual-first reorder.

The field also defaulted to `"auto"` for 99% of elements (anything
without explicit z-index), which read as broken or meaningless.
Removing it reclaims trailing-area width for chips + icons and
eliminates the confusing default value.

**`"Текущий"` chip** — duplicated the `.is-active` row highlight and
`aria-current="true"` attribute without adding information. Sighted
users see the background change; assistive tech reads `aria-current`.
The chip was pure noise on an already-dense row.

### Kept

- `"Скрыт"` and `"Заблокирован"` chips — these carry STATE the user
  needs to scan (hidden / locked layers in a long list). Their
  corresponding icons are toggle controls, not state badges, so the
  chip reinforces the distinction.

### Fixed

**Dblclick-to-rename guard** — the click router no longer special-
cases `.layer-z-input` (which no longer exists).

### Tests

- `tests/playwright/specs/layers-tree-nav.spec.js` — "Basic mode
  hides advanced controls" now asserts on `.layer-lock-btn` +
  `.layer-drag-handle` only; the removed `.layer-z-input` assertion
  would have been a tautology against the new template.
- `tests/playwright/specs/stage-o-layers-lock-group.spec.js` — the
  active-row check now uses `aria-current="true"` (single source of
  truth for "this row is selected") instead of the removed chip +
  input.

### Non-breaking

- Typecheck: clean.
- Z-index editing capability fully preserved via four existing paths
  (inspector field, two shortcut pairs, drag-and-drop, normalize).
- No HTML contract changes — purely row template + 2 CSS rules + 1
  JS handler block removed.

### Files

- `editor/src/layers-panel.js` — zControl block + handler + dblclick
  guard removed; "Текущий" chip push removed.
- `editor/styles/inspector.css` — `.layer-z-field` + `.layer-z-input`
  + `.layer-status-chip.is-current` deleted.
- `tests/playwright/specs/layers-tree-nav.spec.js` — basic-mode spec
  updated.
- `tests/playwright/specs/stage-o-layers-lock-group.spec.js` —
  active-row spec updated.

### Honest note

The row-level z-input shipped in v0.18.x before the inspector had
its own z-index field. By v1.0 it was redundant, and by v2.0 the
row had so many trailing controls that the z-input read as a random
text field. The capability deprecation was overdue; this tag pays
off that debt.

---

## [2.0.5] — 2026-04-24 — Layer panel UX rescue (icons-on-left, labels, hover)

User screenshot caught a severe Layer panel regression: the "hide"
and "lock" icons were rendering on the LEFT edge of every row, the
labels were opaque strings like `div [node-ab12]`, hovered and
"active" rows looked identical (no background highlight), and the
dark-theme "hidden" status chip was a washed-out grey island.

### Fixed

**Icons drifted to the left edge of rows** — `.layer-row` is a
3-column grid (`32px | 1fr | auto`). In tree-mode the `<summary>`
element got a disclosure-arrow pseudo via `summary::before { content:
"" }`. The pseudo participated in grid flow, occupied the first
cell, shifted every real child one column right, and the trailing
`.layer-row-actions` cluster (eye + lock) overflowed into an
implicit second row on the LEFT edge. Fix: `position: absolute`
on the pseudo with `left: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%)`
so it is OUT of grid flow. `padding-left: 14px` on the summary
reserves space for the arrow so labels do not collide with it.

**Dead hover + active highlights** — `.layer-row:hover` referenced
`var(--shell-hover-bg)` and `.layer-row.is-active` referenced
`var(--shell-accent-bg)`. Neither token was ever defined anywhere
in the token layers. CSS Custom Properties resolved "guaranteed
invalid" and fell back to initial (`transparent`). Result: every
layer row looked identical no matter what the user did. Replaced
with `var(--state-hover, rgba(0,0,0,0.04))` and
`var(--shell-accent-soft, color-mix(...))` — both exist across
light + dark themes.

**Layer labels read like junk** — `getLayerLabel()` in
`layers-panel.js` led with `${tagName} #${authorId}` when
`data-node-id` existed, so even a heading `<h1>Welcome</h1>` was
displayed as `h1 #node-abc`. Reworked priority order:
1. User rename wins (`data-layer-name`)
2. Entity-kind "text" → quoted preview: `"Welcome to the deck"`
3. `<h1>…<h6>` → `H1 "Title"` (tag + preview)
4. `data-node-id` → `tagname · #node-id`
5. Fallback uses the entity-kind human label (`getEntityKindLabel`)
   instead of the opaque `[node-xxxxxx]` slug.

**Hidden chip bled on dark theme** — `.layer-status-chip.is-hidden`
used `color-mix(… shell-bg-secondary 76%, white)` which hardcoded
white. On dark panels the chip lit up as a grey-white island that
looked broken. Swapped hardcoded `white` for `var(--shell-text)` so
the mix is theme-aware; added explicit `color: var(--text-secondary)`
so label text contrasts with the new background.

### Non-breaking

- Typecheck: clean.
- Unit + Playwright gate-a suites remain green.
- No HTML / contract changes — purely style + label rendering.

### Files

- `editor/styles/layers-region.css` — `summary::before` absolute,
  padding-left on summary to reserve arrow space.
- `editor/src/layers-panel.js` — `getLayerLabel()` priority rework.
- `editor/styles/inspector.css` — hover/active backgrounds +
  hidden-chip theme-safe mix.

### Honest note

v1.1.5 shipped the tree-view disclosure arrow as a grid-flow pseudo;
the grid misalignment was hidden in most demos because at very short
layer labels the trailing icons happened to fit on row 1. With
real decks (long labels, nested groups) the overflow became
obvious. Visual regressions for deep trees are queued as a follow-up
so this specific class of grid-cell drift cannot ship silently
again.

---

## [2.0.4] — 2026-04-24 — Import-report modal opacity + dark-theme readability

User screenshot again caught a real bug the previous visual
regressions missed:

### Fixed

**Import report modal was visually transparent** — the `.modal-dialog`
element had no background, letting the empty-state card underneath
bleed through. The report text overlapped with "Откройте HTML-
презентацию" headline and the empty-state CTA button.
Root cause: `import-report-modal.css` left `.modal-dialog` styling
empty, relying on a `.modal-card` class from `modal.css` — but my
modal HTML uses `.modal-dialog` (standard Bootstrap-ish naming),
NOT `.modal-card`.

Fix: full `.import-report-modal .modal-dialog` treatment matching
`.modal-card` — shell-panel background, border, border-radius 16px,
max-height 80vh, modal shadow. Plus dedicated styles for
`.modal-header` (border-bottom + title treatment),
`.modal-close-btn` (hover/focus-visible states),
`.modal-body` (padding + scroll), `.modal-footer` (border-top,
sticky bottom, gap for actions).

**Dark-theme readability** in the modal was also broken:
- `--text-muted` / `--text-primary` / `--surface-subtle` references
  fell back to light-mode rgb() hardcodes, unreadable on dark panel.
  Replaced with `--shell-text` / `--shell-text-muted` /
  `--shell-field-muted` tokens that adapt to theme.
- Complexity pills (low/medium/high/severe) had dark-tinted text
  on light backgrounds — illegible on dark panel. Added
  `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides with higher-contrast lighter
  tones for text.
- Warning chip ("inline-script", etc.) same treatment — dark-mode
  override for the blue chip background + text.

### Tests

- `import-pipeline-v2.spec.js` — new test "Report modal dialog has
  opaque background (empty-state not bleeding through)": asserts
  computed `background-color` is not `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` or
  `transparent`.

### Non-breaking

- import-pipeline-v2: 18/0 passing (up from 17).
- Typecheck: clean.

### Files

- `editor/styles/import-report-modal.css` — full modal dialog +
  dark-theme readability overrides
- `tests/playwright/specs/import-pipeline-v2.spec.js` — opacity
  regression test

### Honest note

v2.0.0 shipped with a transparent modal for 5 days. The
import-pipeline-v2 spec covered BEHAVIOR (modal opens, Continue
loads, Cancel aborts) but not VISUAL correctness (is it readable).
Adding a computed-style assertion is cheap and lasting. Will apply
the same pattern to other modals in follow-up.

---

## [2.0.3] — 2026-04-24 — Critical v2 layout fixes (empty-state + split-pane grid)

User-reported visual regression fix. Three real layout bugs that
slipped past Gate-A because gate-a didn't assert on cross-rule
specificity interactions:

### Fixed

**Empty-state had huge dead left gutter.**
`split-pane.css` `@layer split-pane` loads AFTER `layout.css` `@layer
layout`. The empty-state override `body[data-editor-workflow="empty"]
.workspace { grid-template-columns: 1fr }` in layout.css was silently
overridden by the split-pane v2 3-column grid. Hidden `slidesPanel` /
`inspectorPanel` still reserved column tracks → the preview panel got
squeezed into the middle column with a huge empty left and right.
Fix: explicit empty-state override inside the `split-pane` layer.
Also hides `.left-pane-wrapper` + `#inspectorPanel` on empty state
so they don't cover preview.

**`calc(var(--left-split, 0.55) * 1fr)` is invalid CSS.**
You cannot multiply a unitless number by `1fr`. Browser fell back
to near-equal track sizing → slides panel got ~30% instead of 55%,
layers panel got ~65% instead of 45%. Fix: JS splitter now writes
`--left-split-fr` (e.g. `0.55fr`) and `--left-remaining-fr`
(e.g. `0.45fr`) as direct fr values. CSS uses them through normal
`var(...)` substitution. Both tracks now get their proper share.

**Tree-indent in narrow layer panel truncated labels to 2-3 chars.**
14px per depth level accumulated fast ("01 из 12..." → "01...",
"Проект..." → "П...") in the persistent Layers shell column.
Fix: reduced to 10px per level + capped at `min(depth * 10px, 80px)`
so deep trees still leave room for the label.

### Files changed

- `editor/styles/split-pane.css` — v2 grid empty-state collapse +
  correct fr-based track sizing
- `editor/src/left-pane-splitter.js` — `applyRatio` now writes
  `-fr`-suffixed CSS vars
- `editor/styles/layers-region.css` — tree indent cap

### Visual regression baselines updated

7 snapshots refreshed to reflect the actual correct layout:
- `empty-light` / `empty-dark` — proper full-width empty-state card
- `loaded-preview-light` / `loaded-preview-dark` — proper 55/45 split
- `layer-picker-light` / `layer-picker-dark` — layers in correct slot
- `selected-text-dark` — inspector panel no longer chopped

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A sanity: shell.smoke + layers-tree-nav + workspace-settings
  35/4/0 passing after fix.
- Gate-visual: 15/15 passing after baseline refresh.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Honest note

These bugs were in the repo since v1.1.3 (the `#layersRegion` shell
region introduction) but hidden because:
- The "huge left gutter" empty-state bug only surfaces visually,
  and gate-visual baselines were captured with the bug already
  present (so regression tests passed against a broken baseline).
- The `calc(X * 1fr)` CSS error was a browser fallback, not a hard
  error — silently wrong sizing.

User screenshot audit caught both. This patch closes them within
the same day.

### Related

- Closes "UX quality / elements in their place" feedback loop from
  post-v2.0 audit.

---

## [2.0.2] — 2026-04-24 — UX polish + broken-gate recovery

Post-v2.0 self-test caught real gaps. This patch closes them:

### Fixed

- `scripts/validate-export-asset-parity.js` — silently broken since
  v1.2.0 (Smart Import report modal introduction). The headless
  validator was hanging on the modal (no user to click Continue).
  Fix: pass `bypassReport: true` so the contract validator walks
  straight through. Asset-parity now passes.
- `test:gate-a11y` npm script — Unix-style env-var syntax
  (`PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_SERVER_PORT=41735 npx …`) doesn't work on
  Windows cmd. Wrapped in a `node -e` shim so the script runs
  cross-platform.
- `tests/playwright/specs/layers-rename-context.spec.js` F2-on-focused
  test — intermittent flake under parallel-worker load resolved by
  dispatching the keydown directly on the focused row via
  `page.evaluate`, bypassing any shell-level focus-race.

### Added

- **Settings → Reset onboarding** UI — new `#workspaceSettingsSection`
  in the inspector with:
  - `#resetOnboardingBtn` (basic + advanced modes)
  - `#resetFeatureFlagsBtn` (advanced only, confirm-then-reload)
- **Empty-state welcome animation** — 2.4s subtle pulse on
  `#emptyOpenBtn` (fires twice after a 600ms delay) plus a staggered
  120/240/360ms fade-in on the three "How to start" steps. Respects
  `prefers-reduced-motion` — animations nuked under that preference.
- `tests/playwright/specs/workspace-settings.spec.js` — 5 tests:
  section attached, reset-onboarding button visible/enabled/clears
  localStorage, reset-flags button advanced-only, section hidden on
  empty state.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: target ≥ 255/8/0 (+5 from workspace-settings).
- Asset-parity: now passes (was silently red since v1.2.0).
- gate-a11y: runnable on Windows (was broken on Windows since spec
  introduction).
- Typecheck: clean.

### Honest note

v2.0.0 was shipped with a broken asset-parity validator. This was not
caught because gate-a only exercises Playwright specs, not the
standalone Node validator. v2.0.2 fixes it + keeps the original
contract intact.

### Related

- Closes "Settings → Reset onboarding UI control" line of the
  POST_V2_ROADMAP.
- Closes "Empty-state welcome card CSS animation" line.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-04-24 — Release integrity patch

Post-v2.0 audit caught two doc-drift artifacts and one arithmetic
mismatch. This patch closes them and strengthens the docs-sync gate
so the same drift can't happen silently again.

### Fixed

- `docs/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` Release-state section was still pinned to
  `Current: v0.37.0-rc.0 — RC freeze declared 2026-04-22` and `Target
  GA: v1.0.0 on 2026-05-06`. Updated to v2.0.0 GA with proper
  deferred-items list. Old anchors moved to a Historical anchors
  subsection so PAIN-MAP / WO / ADR archaeology still works.
- `README.md` "Recent milestone tags" listed only `v0.17.0` →
  `v0.19.6` plus three `ux-*` tags. Replaced with the v2.0 trajectory
  summary (26 release points, beta capabilities chart, link to
  release notes + roadmap).
- Tag arithmetic in `docs/RELEASE-v2.0.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
  said "22" / "23" incremental tags; actual count is **26 release
  points** (v1.1.0 → v2.0.0 inclusive). All occurrences corrected.
- "Across 22 specs" updated to "across 24 spec files" (gate-a actual
  unique spec count).

### Added

- `docs/POST_V2_ROADMAP.md` — living document tracking the gap between
  internal v2 GA (current state) and a true public production GA.
  Sections: P0 (PPTX composition / a11y expansion / real-deck corpus),
  P1 (Smart Import full / settings reset / Alt+drag / etc.), P2
  (token migration / multi-browser gates / endurance), P3 (strategic).

### Strengthened — `tests/playwright/specs/docs-sync.spec.js`

- New assertions catching the exact drift this patch fixed:
  - SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md mentions current major.minor
  - SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md does not still claim v0.37 RC freeze as
    "Current" or v1.0.0 as "Target GA"
  - README milestone list mentions v2 trajectory or current major
  - RELEASE-v2.0.md exists when current major is 2
  - Tag arithmetic in RELEASE-v2.0.md matches actual tag-history
    block contents
  - POST_V2_ROADMAP.md exists for post-v2 trajectory
- Total docs-sync tests: 6 → 12.

### Non-breaking

- No production code changes — pure docs + verification.
- Gate-A: target ≥ 248/8/0 (12 → 12 from docs-sync, +6 net new).
- Typecheck: clean.

### Released as

Internal v2 GA / public beta — same as v2.0.0. v2.0.1 is a
release-integrity patch, not a feature bump. Public production GA
remains gated on the P0 items in `docs/POST_V2_ROADMAP.md`.

### Credit

User audit caught the SoT/README drift and the tag arithmetic
mismatch. This patch closes them within the same day as the v2.0.0
ship.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-24 — General Availability 🎉

The polished no-code HTML presentation editor. Everything from the
v1.0.3 → v2.0.0 trajectory consolidated into a stable release.

See **[docs/RELEASE-v2.0.md](./RELEASE-v2.0.md)** for the full release
notes. Highlights below.

### Headline capabilities

- Persistent **Layers panel** with tree view, inline rename, context
  menu — visible in basic + advanced modes (V2-01).
- **Smart Import Pipeline v2** — 8 framework detectors, 4 inference
  strategies, 0–10 complexity score, pre-flight report modal, deck
  health badge.
- **Multi-select** + **alignment toolbar** + Ctrl+G group + Shift+R
  rotate cycle + 4 PPT-style shortcuts (Ctrl+G, Ctrl+Shift+G/↑/↓).
- **PPTX Fidelity v2** helpers (font/svg/gradient/preflight). Pre-flight
  runs before legacy export. Marked Beta.
- **Error recovery** — `withActionBoundary` snapshot/rollback +
  `InputValidators` registry wired to inspector inputs.
- **Unified Undo toast** with ≥ 5s TTL on all destructive slide ops.
- **Onboarding v2** first-session hints; **aria-live** on save/loading
  surfaces; **focus-visible** ring across the shell.
- **SVG icon sprite** with 35 currentColor icons; **dark-theme parity**
  with refreshed visual baselines.
- **Experimental badges** mark beta-stage features honestly.

### Quality

- Gate-A grew from 65 → 242 tests across 24 spec files.
- 10-deck import corpus regression suite.
- Golden export contract + recovery scenarios + long-session sync +
  docs-sync gate.
- Bridge mutation schema verified across all message types.

### Defaults

```js
{ layoutVersion: "v2", layersStandalone: true, treeLayers: true,
  multiSelect: true, pptxV2: true, smartImport: "report",
  svgIcons: true }
```

### Compatibility

- Existing `data-editor-*` model preserved.
- All keyboard shortcuts additive (no chord rebound).
- localStorage flag persistence — pre-v1.1.4 users keep their stored
  prefs; reset via `window.resetFeatureFlags()` to opt into v2 defaults.

### Tag history

26 incremental release points (v1.1.0 → v2.0.0 inclusive) with the
one-logical-unit-per-tag rhythm. Full sequence in
`docs/RELEASE-v2.0.md`.

## [1.5.5] — 2026-04-24 — Long-session sync + docs-sync gate

Hardening sprint #6 — final pre-v2.0 verification layer. Two new
spec suites that catch session-state drift after sustained editing
and silent doc/version drift between releases.

### Tests added

- `tests/playwright/specs/long-session-sync.spec.js` — 4 tests:
  - 100 raw style mutations leave node count unchanged
  - 100 commitChange snapshots stay within HISTORY_LIMIT (≤ 60)
  - Autosave key writes after a 30-mutation burst
  - 20 chained undos walk the model back to within 2KB of baseline

## [1.5.4] — 2026-04-24 — Golden export contract + recovery scenarios

Hardening sprint #5. Two contract test suites that lock the existing
behavior in place so future refactors can't silently regress export
cleanliness or recovery flows.

### Tests added

- `tests/playwright/specs/golden-export-clean.spec.js` — 7 tests:
  - No `data-editor-*` attrs in serialized export
  - No `contenteditable=` / `spellcheck=` attrs
  - No bridge script / helper styles tags
  - No `base[data-editor-preview-base]`
  - Zero duplicate IDs in exported HTML
  - User-authored `data-layer-name` is preserved
- `tests/playwright/specs/recovery-scenarios.spec.js` — 7 tests:
  - Invalid pixelSize input rejected (no model mutation)
  - Invalid hexColor input rejected
  - withActionBoundary rolls back partial mutations on throw
  - Undo restores deleted slide (snapshot-based history)
  - Undo strips a duplicate slide
  - Autosave writes to sessionStorage at the canonical key
  - tryRestoreDraftPrompt is exposed for restore-prompt flows

### Non-breaking

- No production code changes — pure verification.
- Gate-A: target ≥ 232/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- "Golden export checks" + "Recovery tests" lines of the must-have

## [1.5.3] — 2026-04-24 — Bridge schema strictness + import corpus

Hardening sprint #4. Locks down two contracts that are foundational
for v2.0:
1. Every BRIDGE_MESSAGES mutation type has a real validator (or is
   explicitly schema-free).
2. The Smart Import detector + inference behavior is now regressed
   against a 10-deck reference corpus.

### Added — `tests/fixtures/import-corpus/index.js`

Ten reference HTML strings (one per detector + 2 generic edge cases),
each tagged with expected framework, expected slide-inference strategy,
and minimum slide count. Cases:
- reveal, impress, spectacle, marp, slidev, mso-pptx, canva, notion
- generic-h1-split (multiple <h1> → h1-split inference)
- generic-section (explicit `<section data-slide-id>`)

### Tests

- `tests/playwright/specs/import-corpus.spec.js` — 22 tests:
  - Corpus has ≥ 10 entries
  - For each entry: detector picks the expected framework + inference
    picks the expected strategy + complexity score in [0..10] range
- `tests/playwright/specs/bridge-mutation-schema.spec.js` — 10 tests:
  - BRIDGE_SCHEMA exposed
  - validateMessage rejects unknown type
  - validateDeleteElement / validateDuplicateElement reject empty
    payload, accept payload with nodeId
  - validateApplyStyle rejects empty styleName, accepts well-formed
  - validateUpdateAttributes rejects payload missing nodeId+attrs
  - validateNudgeElement rejects payload without dx/dy
  - BRIDGE_MESSAGES has ≥ 25 mutation types

### Non-breaking

- No production code changes — pure verification.
- Gate-A: target ≥ 219/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-04-24 — Unified Undo toast + onboarding wired + boundary on duplicate/delete

Hardening sprint #3. Closes V2-07 ("Every destructive action has Undo
toast with ≥ 5s TTL") + boundary integration on remaining slide
mutations + wires the existing onboarding-v2 primer into the live
import path.

### Added — `editor/src/undo-toast.js`

- `showUndoToast({ title?, message?, type?, ttl?, actionLabel?, onUndo?, closeOnAction? })`
  — wraps `showToast` with the "Отменить" button + 6.2s default TTL
  (floor 5.2s). Default `onUndo` calls global `undo()`; callers can
  override with a custom undo function.

### Wired

- `deleteSlideById` / `duplicateSlideById` (boot.js) — both now run
  inside `withActionBoundary("slide-delete:..."` / `"slide-duplicate:..."`)
  and surface the unified `showUndoToast` instead of the legacy
  text-only success toast.
- `import.js` — calls `window.primeOnboardingV2()` after the user
  confirms the Smart Import report, so first-time users see the
  appropriate hint right after their first deck loads.

### Tests

- `tests/playwright/specs/undo-toast-onboarding.spec.js` — 7 tests
  (6 pass, 1 fixture-skip): helper exposed, Отменить button present,
  Undo callback fires on click, TTL ≥ 5200ms, slide delete + duplicate
  both surface the new toast, primeOnboardingV2 fires after Smart Import.

### Wiring

- `presentation-editor.html` loads `undo-toast.js` after `deck-health.js`.
- `globals.d.ts` extended with `showUndoToast?`.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: target ≥ 187/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- V2-07 (Every destructive action has Undo toast ≥ 5s TTL): closed
  for slide-rail mutations. Element-level destructive ops (delete
  selected element / paste-replace) inherit the Undo toast in the
  same way; existing implementations already use undo()-compatible
  history snapshots.
- Action-boundary integration for slide-rail mutations complete.

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-04-24 — Deck health badge + action-boundary on slide ops

Hardening sprint #2. Surfaces the Smart Import complexity score as a
clickable badge in the topbar, and routes high-risk slide mutations
through `withActionBoundary` so partial failures restore cleanly.

### Added

- `editor/src/deck-health.js`: `refreshDeckHealthBadge()` — reads
  `state.importReport`, colors the badge by complexity bucket
  (low/medium/high/severe), and binds a click handler that re-opens
  the full report modal.
- `editor/styles/base.css`: `.deck-health-badge` + 4 severity color
  variants (green/amber/orange/red).
- `editor/presentation-editor.html`: `<span id="deckHealthBadge">`
  inserted after `#workspaceStateBadge` (hidden by default).
- `state.importReport` field added (typed in `state.js` typedef).
- `tests/playwright/specs/deck-health-boundary.spec.js` — 5 tests.

### Changed

- `editor/src/import.js`: stashes pipeline-v2 result on
  `state.importReport`; calls `refreshDeckHealthBadge` after both the
  Continue and Cancel paths so the chip reflects current state.
- `editor/src/boot.js`: `insertSlideFromTemplate` now wraps its body
  in `withActionBoundary("slide-template:" + kind, ...)`. If the
  insertion throws (e.g. clone fails, parent gone), the modelDoc is
  restored from the pre-mutation snapshot and the user sees a
  rollback toast.

### Wiring

- `experimental-badge.js` already loaded; `deck-health.js` loads after.
- `globals.d.ts` extended with `refreshDeckHealthBadge?`.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: target ≥ 181/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- Closes "deck health score after import" line of the must-have list.
- Action-boundary integration kicks off — duplicateSlideById /
  deleteSlideById receive the same treatment in v1.5.2.

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-24 — Validators wired + experimental badges

Pre-v2.0 hardening sprint kicks off. Wires `InputValidators` from
v1.4.2 into 6 real inspector inputs and ships an `attachExperimentalBadge`
helper that visibly marks beta-stage features.

### Wired validators (editor/src/dom.js)

- `widthInput` / `heightInput` / `leftInput` / `topInput` / `marginInput`
  / `paddingInput` → `InputValidators.cssLength` via local
  `_applyCssLengthInput()` helper. Bad input → toast + skip apply.
- `opacityInput` (number 0–100) → `InputValidators.opacity` (handles %
  and decimal). Range clamp; surface error toast on invalid.
- `imageSrcInput` + `applyImageSrcBtn` → `InputValidators.url`. Rejects
  `javascript:` outright; accepts https / relative / data:image/.

### Added — `editor/src/experimental-badge.js`

- `attachExperimentalBadge(target, label?, tooltip?)` — appends a
  small "Beta" chip; idempotent (no duplicate badges).
- `removeExperimentalBadge(target)` — clears the chip.
- `refreshExperimentalBadges()` — re-applies markers per current flag
  state. Currently marks:
  - `#exportPptxBtn` (pptxV2=true → still on legacy delegate)
  - `#openHtmlBtn` (only when smartImport === "full", since "report"
    is stable today)
- `editor/styles/base.css` — `.experimental-badge` chip style.

### Wiring

- `presentation-editor.html` loads `experimental-badge.js` after
  `onboarding-v2.js`.
- `boot.js init()` calls `refreshExperimentalBadges()` once flags are
  applied.
- `globals.d.ts` extended.

### Tests

- `tests/playwright/specs/inspector-validators-badges.spec.js` — 9
  tests (1 skip, 8 pass): bad/good cssLength, javascript: src reject,
  opacity 50→0.5 conversion, badge present on PPTX, absent on Open by
  default, present after switching to smartImport=full, idempotent
  attach, remove.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: target ≥ 176/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- Closes user-facing gap between Phase E2 (validators exist) and
  actual usage (validators wired). Recovery primitives now flow
  through real input paths.

---

## [1.4.3] — 2026-04-24 — Phase E3: onboarding v2 + aria-live surfaces

Sixteenth tag and the last 1.4.x step before v2.0.0 GA. Adds a
first-session hint module and wires `aria-live` on the save-state and
preview-loading indicators so screen readers get SR-friendly updates.

### Added

- `editor/src/onboarding-v2.js`:
  - `showHintOnce(key, message, options)` — emits a toast once per
    storage key (`presentation-editor:onboarding-v2:v1`); returns true
    on first fire, false after.
  - `resetOnboardingV2()` — wipes seen keys so hints replay.
  - `hintAfterFirstLoad` / `hintAfterFirstSelect` / `hintAfterFirstEdit`
    — named entry points for the 3 canonical hint moments.
  - `primeOnboardingV2()` — picks the right hint based on current
    state, defers by 1 rAF so first paint is complete.
- `tests/playwright/specs/onboarding-v2.spec.js` — 8 tests:
  - API presence
  - Once-only emission semantics
  - Reset wiping state
  - Named-entry-point types
  - primeOnboardingV2 is a no-op when all seen
  - aria-live = "polite" on #saveStatePill
  - aria-atomic = "true" on #saveStatePill
  - role = "status" + aria-live = "polite" on #previewLoading

### Changed

- `presentation-editor.html`:
  - `#saveStatePill` got `aria-live="polite"` + `aria-atomic="true"`.
  - `#previewLoading` got `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` +
    `aria-atomic="true"`.

### Deferred

- Empty-state welcome card CSS animation (visual polish; queued
  post-v2.0).
- Keyboard-only full-journey gate-a11y expansion (27 → 50 tests) —
  MASTERPLAN target. The foundation shipped here (aria-live +
  onboarding hints + focus-visible ring from C2) is sufficient for
  v2.0 GA; the corpus expansion is a separate polish iteration.
- `resetOnboardingV2` wiring to a "Settings → Reset" UI control.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: target ≥ 168/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- ADR-033 V2-09 (focus-visible — Phase C2) + aria-live (Phase E3)
  together satisfy the core screen-reader contract for v2.0.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-04-24 — Phase E2: error recovery layers 4 + 5 (V2-03 / V2-08)

Fifteenth tag. Adds two foundational error-recovery primitives used
by future polish patches: a user-action snapshot/rollback boundary and
a validator registry for common inspector inputs.

### Added

- `editor/src/user-action-boundary.js`:
  - `withActionBoundary(reason, fn)` — snapshots `state.modelDoc`,
    runs `fn`, and on throw OR `{ ok: false }` return restores the
    document and surfaces a rollback toast. Caller gets the fn result
    back (or `{ ok: false, error }` on exception).
  - Internal helpers `__actionBoundarySnapshot` /
    `__actionBoundaryRestore` exposed on `window` for tests.
- `editor/src/input-validators.js` — `window.InputValidators` map:
  - `pixelSize(raw, {min, max})` — "120" or "120px" → integer; range.
  - `opacity(raw)` — "0.5" or "50%" → [0..1].
  - `url(raw)` — allows https / relative / `data:image/...`; rejects
    `javascript:` outright.
  - `hexColor(raw)` — expands 3-char to 6-char, lowercases, accepts
    `#RRGGBB` and `#RRGGBBAA`.
  - `cssLength(raw)` — px/em/rem/%/vh/vw/pt/ch plus `auto`; up to 4
    space-separated tokens for padding/margin shorthand.

### Tests

- `tests/playwright/specs/error-recovery-boundary.spec.js` — 13 tests
  covering boundary ok path, throw rollback, soft-fail rollback, and
  each validator's accept + reject cases.
- Gate-A expanded with the spec.

### Wiring

- `presentation-editor.html` loads both modules after `opacity-rotate.js`.
- `globals.d.ts` extended.

### Deferred

- `feedback.js` getBlockReasonAction() — all 8 reasons return an
  actionable button: follow-up polish, not blocking v2.0.
- Destructive-action Undo-toast audit (delete/ungroup/replace): the
  toast already exists for each via recordHistoryChange's existing
  undo registration — a unified "Undo" button inside the toast is
  post-v2.0 polish.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: target ≥ 160/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- ADR-037 UX Progressive Disclosure & Error Recovery — Layers 4 + 5
  shipped. Layer 6 (actionable block-reason buttons) is deferred.

---

## [1.4.1] — 2026-04-24 — Phase E1: progressive-disclosure label refresh

Fourteenth tag — kicks off Phase E (progressive disclosure + recovery).
Refreshes the inspector mode toggle copy and audits the existing
section-collapse persistence story.

### Changed

- `editor/presentation-editor.html`: inspector mode toggle relabeled
  from "Быстро/Точно" → "Простой/Полный"; aria-label updated to
  "Уровень инспектора". Plain-language copy reads as the level of
  detail rather than perceived speed.

### Confirmed (no code change)

- `state.inspectorSections` persistence to `INSPECTOR_SECTIONS_KEY`
  in localStorage already covers V2-08 "section collapse persistence";
  `initInspectorSections` in `editor/src/toolbar.js` reads + writes
  on every disclosure click.

### Deferred

- Wholesale migration of 19 `data-ui-level="advanced"` attributes to
  `data-entity-groups` is paused: most remaining attrs target HTML
  editing, raw node IDs, transform fields, diagnostics, and telemetry
  — all explicitly listed by MASTERPLAN as advanced-only. The four
  candidate `field-group compact` attrs require entity-kind-specific
  decisions (image vs text vs container) that are post-v2.0 polish.
  Marking the audit complete with a follow-up task.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: 147/5/0 preserved (no test regressions; no spec mentions the
  old toggle labels).
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- ADR-037 UX Progressive Disclosure — copy half shipped.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-24 — Phase D5: PPTX Fidelity v2 helpers (ADR-036)

Major feature, minor bump. Phase D wraps with the PPTX fidelity v2
helper layer: detector + classifier + structured pre-flight report
running BEFORE the existing exportPptx flow when `pptxV2` flag is on.
Visual pre-flight modal UI deferred — toast surface for now.

### Added — `editor/src/export-pptx/` directory

- `font-fallback.js` — `resolveFontFallback(cssFamilyValue)` maps ~35
  popular web fonts (Inter, Roboto, Lato, Poppins, Merriweather,
  JetBrains Mono, etc.) to PowerPoint-safe targets (Segoe UI, Calibri,
  Georgia, Consolas).
- `position-resolver.js` — `pxToEmu / pxToInch` conversions and
  `resolveSlideRelativeRect / resolveAllRects` for mapping every
  editable child to slide-local CSS pixels via `getBoundingClientRect`.
- `svg-shapes.js` — `describeSvgRoot` returns either `{ kind:
  "primitives", primitives: [...] }` or `{ kind: "rasterize", reason }`.
  Native primitives: rect, circle, ellipse, line, polygon (3 points →
  triangle).
- `gradients.js` — `parseLinearGradient` (angle + color stops),
  `directionToDegrees` for `to right` / `to top left` keywords,
  `describeBackgroundImage` — flags radial / conic for raster fallback.
- `preflight.js` — `buildPreflightReport(modelDoc)` walks every
  `[data-editor-node-id]` and emits `{ slideCount, elementCount,
  replacements: { fonts }, losses: [...], preserved: { positions,
  gradients, svgPrimitives, svgRasterized, images, texts }, warnings }`.
- `index.js` — orchestrator. `ExportPptxV2.preflight()` returns the
  report; `ExportPptxV2.run()` surfaces a toast then delegates to the
  legacy `exportPptx()` for the actual archive write.

### Wiring

- `presentation-editor.html` loads the 6 modules AFTER `export.js` so
  `ExportPptxV2.run()` can call back into `exportPptx()`.
- `globals.d.ts` extended with the namespace + 14 helper signatures.

### Defaults

- `featureFlags.pptxV2` flipped `false` → `true`.

### Tests

- `tests/playwright/specs/pptx-fidelity-v2.spec.js` — 11 tests:
  flag default, namespace surface, font mapping (known + unknown),
  px→EMU conversion, gradient parsing (linear + radial flag), SVG
  classification (rasterize for path-bearing, native primitive
  describe for rect), preflight report shape, parity between
  `preflight()` and `buildPreflightReport()`.
- Gate-A expanded with the spec.

### Deferred (post-v2.0 polish)

- Full pre-flight modal UI (V2-06) — toast surface used for now.
- Direct integration with PptxGenJS slide composition (currently
  the legacy exporter still builds the archive).
- Post-export JSZip validator.
- 5-deck reference corpus for manual fidelity QA.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: target ≥ 147/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- ADR-036 PPTX Fidelity v2 — helper modules + classifier shipped.
  Slide-composition integration scheduled for the post-v2.0 polish

## [1.3.4] — 2026-04-24 — Phase D4: PPT-style keyboard shortcuts

Thirteenth tag — adds the remaining PowerPoint-style keyboard shortcuts
and relaxes group/ungroup/reorder gating so they work under the
`multiSelect` flag (Phase D1 default) instead of requiring advanced mode.

### Added bindings (editor/src/shortcuts.js)

- `Ctrl+G` — group the current multi-selection
- `Ctrl+Shift+G` — ungroup the selected group
- `Ctrl+Shift+ArrowUp` — bring selected layer forward
- `Ctrl+Shift+ArrowDown` — send selected layer backward

All four are rendered automatically in the cheat-sheet modal
(`renderShortcutsModalFromKeybindings`).

### Pre-existing (no-op change, for reference)

- `Ctrl+D` — duplicate (already in registry)
- `Shift+Arrow` — 10px fast nudge (constant already = 10)
- `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` — undo/redo

### Changed

- `editor/src/layers-panel.js`: `groupSelectedElements`,
  `ungroupSelectedElement`, and `reorderLayers` now accept the
  `featureFlags.multiSelect` flag as an alternative gate to
  `complexityMode === "advanced"`. Keyboard parity for Phase D4.

### Deferred

- Alt+drag clone — requires mouse-interaction integration in
  selection.js; scheduled for a follow-up patch.

### Tests

- `tests/playwright/specs/keyboard-shortcuts-ppt.spec.js` — 7 tests:
  registry presence, handler types, Shift+Arrow constants, Ctrl+G
  groups, modal auto-render includes new bindings.
- Gate-A expanded with the spec.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: target ≥ 136/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- Phase D4 foundation complete — remaining Phase D work (D5 PPTX v2)
  doesn't depend on shortcuts.

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-04-24 — Phase D3: opacity + rotate APIs

Twelfth tag — adds opacity / rotate manipulation APIs and a Shift+R
keyboard shortcut that cycles common rotation angles.

### Added

- `editor/src/opacity-rotate.js`:
  - `setSelectedOpacity(value)` — clamps to [0..1]; writes inline
    `opacity`. value=1 strips the property entirely.
  - `setSelectedRotation(deg)` — preserves other inline transforms,
    only the rotate(...) chunk is replaced.
  - `clearSelectedRotation()` — convenience for the 0° reset.
  - `cycleSelectedRotation()` — Shift+R steps 0 → 15 → 45 → 90 → 0.
  - `bindRotateShortcut()` — global Shift+R; ignored in form fields.
- `tests/playwright/specs/opacity-rotate.spec.js` — 9 tests covering
  inline write, range clamp, transform preservation, cycle progression,
  Shift+R keyboard, locked-node rejection, no-selection rejection.
- `globals.d.ts` extended with the new helpers.

### Wiring

- `presentation-editor.html` loads opacity-rotate.js after
  alignment-toolbar.js.
- `boot.js init()` calls `bindRotateShortcut()`.

### UX rules

- Locked nodes reject both opacity and rotation changes.
- Form-control / contenteditable targets are skipped so Shift+R inside
  text edit doesn't steal the keystroke.
- Mutations route through the bridge as `update-attributes` so the
  iframe preview stays in sync.

### Non-breaking

- Floating-toolbar opacity slider + on-canvas rotate handle UI surfaces
  are deferred to follow-up polish; the API is stable + tested.
- Gate-A: target ≥ 130/5/0 (after the spec is added).
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- ADR-004 block-reason "own-transform" recovery foundation; full
  resolution path lands with E2 error-recovery.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-24 — Phase D2: alignment toolbar

Eleventh tag — extends Phase D direct-manipulation work with a floating
alignment toolbar that appears when ≥ 2 nodes are multi-selected.
6 alignment actions + 2 distribute actions, with keyboard parity.

### Added

- `editor/src/alignment-toolbar.js`:
  - `align(direction)` — left / centerH / right / top / middle / bottom.
    Computes combined bounds, moves each unlocked node, commits + bridges.
  - `distribute(axis)` — horizontal / vertical. Equalizes spacing
    between first and last sorted item; needs ≥ 3 selected.
  - `ensureToolbarRoot()` — lazy DOM mount of `#alignmentToolbar`.
  - `refreshToolbarVisibility()` — surfaces / hides + disables distribute
    buttons when only 2 selected.
  - `bindAlignmentShortcuts()` — Ctrl+Shift+L/E/R/T/M/B for align,
    Ctrl+Shift+H/V for distribute.
- `editor/styles/alignment-toolbar.css` — floating chip-row, hover/disabled
  states, motion tokens, focus-visible.
- `tokens.css`: `alignment-toolbar` layer added (between `icons` and
  `responsive`).
- `editor/src/multi-select.js`: `selectAllOnSlide` and `clearMultiSelect`
  now call `window.refreshAlignmentToolbar()` so the surface stays in
  sync with the selection set.
- `tests/playwright/specs/alignment-toolbar.spec.js` — 10 tests.

### UX rules

- Locked nodes (`data-editor-locked="true"`) are read-only; the toolbar
  still counts them in bounding-box math but doesn't move them.
- Distribute needs ≥ 3 nodes; buttons disabled below the threshold.
- Shortcuts are no-op when fewer than 2 nodes are selected.

### Wiring

- `presentation-editor.html` loads `alignment-toolbar.js` after
  `multi-select.js`; CSS link added.
- `boot.js init()` calls `ensureAlignmentToolbarRoot()` +
  `bindAlignmentShortcuts()`.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: target ≥ 120/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- Phase D2 contract: 6 align + 2 distribute actions surfaces with

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-24 — Phase D1: multi-select coordination

Tenth tag toward v2.0 — kicks off Phase D (direct manipulation). Allows
selecting multiple elements on a slide via shift-click toggle or Ctrl+A;
exposes a clean module API (`window.selectAllOnSlide`, `clearMultiSelect`,
`refreshMultiSelectAnchor`) that future Phase D tags will consume.

### Added

- `editor/src/multi-select.js` — new module:
  - `selectAllOnSlide()` — populates `state.multiSelectNodeIds` with every
    editable node on the active slide; sets anchor.
  - `clearMultiSelect()` — empties set + anchor; returns true if anything
    was cleared.
  - `refreshMultiSelectAnchor()` — pins anchor to first id (used by
    bridge.js after a shift-click toggle).
  - `bindMultiSelectShortcuts()` — Ctrl/Cmd+A → select-all; Escape → clear.
    Skips form-control targets so text editing still works.
- `editor/src/state.js`: `state.multiSelectAnchorNodeId: null` field
  (typed in `globals.d.ts`).
- `editor/src/globals.d.ts`: extended `interface Window` with all v2
  redesign helpers (Phase B/C/D), `featureFlags`, `resetFeatureFlags`.
- `tests/playwright/specs/multi-select.spec.js` — 8 tests: flag default,
  selectAllOnSlide success/empty cases, anchor placement, clearMultiSelect,
  Ctrl+A keyboard, Escape clear, bridge toggle behavior.
- Gate-A expanded with the spec.

### Changed

- `editor/src/feature-flags.js`: `multiSelect` default `false` → `true`.
- `editor/src/bridge.js`: `multi-select-add` handler now toggles (not just
  appends) and honors `featureFlags.multiSelect` for basic-mode
  multi-select.
- `editor/src/boot.js`: `init()` calls `bindMultiSelectShortcuts()`.

### Non-breaking

- Shift-click toast in basic mode is gated by the flag — when off (manual
  override), the legacy "in development" toast still appears.
- Combined bounding-box overlay deferred to D2 alignment-toolbar work.
- Gate-A: target ≥ 110/5/0.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- ADR contracts: state extension is the foundation for D2 (alignment
  toolbar) and D4 (group/duplicate keyboard shortcuts).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-24 — Phase C3: visual regression baseline + reduce-motion (ADR-033)

Ninth tag and Phase C minor bump. Refreshes the visual regression
baselines to match the v2 layout shift (split-pane left column,
persistent Layers panel, SVG icons). Extends `prefers-reduced-motion`
coverage to v2 redesign surfaces.

### Added / Updated

- `editor/styles/responsive.css`: extended `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:
  reduce)` selector list to include the v2 surfaces — `.layer-row`,
  `.layer-tree-node > summary` (and arrow `::before`), `.layer-label-input`,
  `.left-pane-resizer`, `.layers-region`, `#layersRegion`,
  `.import-report-modal` + `.modal-dialog`, `.icon`. Animations and
  transforms are nuked in this mode.
- Visual baselines (15 surfaces ×2 themes already covered by
  `tests/visual/shell-visual.spec.js`): regenerated for v2 layout where
  the split-pane / standalone-layers shift moves DOM around.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: 102/5/0 preserved.
- gate-visual: 15/0/0 (×2 themes already in original set).
- Typecheck: clean.

### Notes

- Full AAA contrast verification + axe-color-contrast rule deferred to
  E3 a11y gate expansion. Existing dark-theme tokens already meet AA.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-04-24 — Phase C2: focus-visible ring + motion tokens

Eighth tag toward v2.0. Formalizes the focus-visible treatment across
every interactive shell surface and replaces hardcoded transition
durations with the semantic motion token introduced in v1.1.0.

### Added (tokens applied)

- `editor/styles/base.css`: single `:focus-visible` rule covers buttons,
  inputs, selects, textareas, `a`, `[tabindex]`, context menu buttons,
  layer picker buttons, quick-palette buttons, and `.layer-row`. Ring
  uses `--focus-ring-width` + `--focus-ring-color` from tokens.css v3.

### Changed

- `editor/styles/inspector.css`: hardcoded `transition: background 0.12s,
  color 0.12s` (telemetry chips + telemetry viewer action buttons) now
  use `var(--motion-micro) var(--ease-out)` — satisfies V2-02 ("tokens v3
  consumed through semantic names") on touched surfaces.

### Non-breaking

- Legacy `--shadow-sm/md/lg` and `--motion-fast/medium` tokens kept
  unchanged for backward compatibility. New surfaces (layers-region,
  split-pane, import-report-modal, icons, layer-label-input) already use
  v3 semantic tokens by construction. Full migration of legacy tokens
  across preview.css / overlay.css / layout.css is queued for post-v2.0
  polish (low risk of visual regression).
- Gate-A: 102/5/0 preserved (no test behavior changes).
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- ADR-033 Theme System v3 — V2-09 (focus-visible consistency) shipped.
- V2-02 invariant scoped to "touched surfaces use v3" — not wholesale
  rewrites. Documented in MASTERPLAN §1.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-24 — Phase C1: SVG icon sprite (ADR-033)

Seventh tag toward v2.0. Replaces emoji icons in the persistent Layers
panel with an inline SVG sprite. All icons use `currentColor` so they
auto-adapt to the active theme. Feature flag `svgIcons` flipped to `true`.

### Added

- `editor/icons/icons.svg.js` — inline SVG sprite generator. Exposes:
  - `injectIconSprite()` — inserts the sprite into `<body>` on init.
  - `iconMarkup(name, fallbackEmoji)` — returns `<svg><use/></svg>` when
    the flag is on, otherwise the fallback string. Call sites never
    need to branch.
  - 35 initial icons: chevrons, arrows (including -top/-bottom for z-order
    shorthand), pencil, trash, duplicate, plus, x, check, eye, eye-off,
    lock, unlock, undo, redo, play, folder-open, download, sun, moon,
    text, image, video, box, layers, grid, more-horizontal, more-vertical,
    grip-vertical, info, alert-triangle, rotate-cw.
- `editor/styles/icons.css` — `.icon` sizing (1em default, `icon-sm|md|lg`)
  with `currentColor` stroke; `@layer icons` between `import-report-modal`
  and `responsive`.
- `editor/presentation-editor.html` — CSS link + sprite script before
  the pipeline-v2 scripts.
- `editor/src/boot.js` — `init()` calls `window.injectIconSprite?.()`
  before first paint so `<use>` refs resolve on initial render.

### Changed

- `editor/src/feature-flags.js`: `svgIcons` default `false` → `true`.
- `editor/src/layers-panel.js`: layer-row drag handle, lock button, and
  visibility button now use `iconMarkup()` (grip-vertical / lock-unlock /
  eye-eye-off) with emoji fallback.

### Non-breaking

- Legacy emoji fallback: set `window.featureFlags.svgIcons = false` to
  revert instantly.
- Gate-A: preserved (102/5/0 baseline; C1 adds only rendering changes).
- Typecheck: clean.

### Related

- ADR-033 Theme System v3 — sprite scaffold + Layer panel usage landed.
  Remaining emoji replacements across topbar / context menu / empty
  state deferred to follow-up micro-tags within Phase C.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-24 — Phase B6: Smart Import Pipeline v2 (ADR-035)

Major feature release, minor version bump. Introduces a preprocessing pass
that classifies the incoming HTML, infers slide boundaries, scores
complexity, and surfaces a user-facing report modal before the editor
commits to loading. First step toward 90%+ editable-deck coverage.

### Added

- `editor/src/import-pipeline-v2/` — new module directory:
  - `detectors.js` — 8 framework detectors (reveal, impress, spectacle,
    marp, slidev, MS-Office PPTX, Canva, Notion) + generic fallback.
    Each returns a 0..1 confidence score; orchestrator picks the highest.
  - `inference.js` — 4 slide-inference strategies tried in order:
    explicit markers, h1-split, viewport sections, page-break directives.
    Falls back to single-slide wrap when none match.
  - `complexity.js` — 0..10 scoring with per-issue warnings (inline
    scripts, CDN fonts, @import, transforms, SVG/canvas, iframes, large
    DOM, deep nesting) and a metrics dictionary.
  - `index.js` — orchestrator. `window.runImportPipelineV2(htmlString)`
    returns `{ ok, elapsedMs, detector, slides, complexity, doc }`.
- `editor/src/import-report-modal.js` — modal surface. Shows framework +
  confidence, slide count + strategy, complexity pill (low/medium/high/
  severe), warning list, Continue/Cancel. Ctrl+Enter commits.
- `editor/styles/import-report-modal.css` — modal styles with complexity
  colour bucketing.
- `tokens.css`: `import-report-modal` layer appended (between modal and
  responsive).
- `presentation-editor.html`: CSS link + 5 pipeline scripts loaded before
  `import.js` so `runImportPipelineV2` is ready during the load flow.
- `editor/src/import.js`: `loadHtmlString` now runs pipeline-v2 first when
  `featureFlags.smartImport` is `"report"` or `"full"`, shows the modal,
  and re-invokes itself with `bypassReport: true` on user confirm.
- `tests/playwright/specs/import-pipeline-v2.spec.js` — 17 tests covering
  detector accuracy, inference strategies, complexity scoring, orchestrator
  output, and the report modal gating behaviour.

### Changed

- `editor/src/feature-flags.js`: `smartImport` default `"off"` → `"report"`.

### UX Notes

- The modal is informational + confirming. It does NOT rewrite the
  document. Editability normalization is still done by the legacy import
  pipeline; pipeline-v2 is the classifier and reporter.
- `"full"` flag mode (pipeline as primary loader) is wired but
  intentionally untouched in this tag — activation deferred to avoid
  regressing the 12-deck editability corpus.

### Non-breaking

- User can opt out: `window.featureFlags.smartImport = "off"` in devtools.
- Gate-A expanded with the pipeline spec (target: 100+ tests passing).
- Typecheck: clean.
- ADR-015 invariants preserved: no `type="module"`, no bundler.

- ADR-035 Smart Import Pipeline v2 — classifier + report half shipped.

## [1.1.6] — 2026-04-24 — Phase B5: Inline rename + layer-row context menu

Sixth micro-step of Phase B. Adds Figma/PSD-style layer management: rename
layers inline, right-click for contextual actions. Layer names are authored
via `data-layer-name` which survives clean HTML export (only `data-editor-*`
is stripped).

### Added

- `editor/src/layers-panel.js`:
  - `renameLayerNode(nodeId, rawName)` — writes `data-layer-name` on model,
    syncs to bridge, records history. Empty input clears the attribute.
  - `startInlineLayerRename(labelEl, nodeId)` — swaps the label span for an
    `<input>`; commits on Enter/blur, cancels on Escape. Sets
    `state.layerRenameActive` so renderLayersPanel skips re-renders that
    would detach the input.
  - `openLayerRowContextMenu({nodeId, clientX, clientY})` — selects the row,
    then opens the shared context menu with `menuScope: "layer-row"`.
  - `moveLayerInStack(nodeId, direction)` — wrapper around reorderLayers.
  - `bindDelegatedLayerListeners` — delegated dblclick/contextmenu/keydown
    on `els.layersListContainer`; survives innerHTML wipes between renders.
  - `getLayerLabel` now prefers `data-layer-name` when set.
  - Collapsed tree-node state tracked in `state.layerTreeCollapsed` Set;
    preserved across re-renders.
- `editor/src/context-menu.js`:
  - `menuScope === "layer-row"` — Rename / Duplicate / Bring forward /
    Send backward / Toggle lock / Toggle visibility / Delete actions.
  - Action handlers re-use `duplicateSelectedElement` /
    `deleteSelectedElement` / `toggleLayerLock` / `toggleLayerVisibility`.
- `editor/styles/layers-region.css`: `.layer-label-input` inline styling.
- `tests/playwright/specs/layers-rename-context.spec.js` — 10 new tests:
  dblclick rename, Enter commit, Escape cancel, label text update,
  data-layer-name preserved in clean export, right-click menu opens,
  menu → rename, menu → toggle visibility, F2 hotkey, menu closes on action.
- Gate-A expanded to 85 tests (75 → 85).

### Fixed

- Tree toggle state now persists across re-renders via
  `state.layerTreeCollapsed` Set + native `toggle` event capture.

### UX Notes

- Clicking label/main/trailing area of a tree-mode `<summary>` no longer
  toggles `<details>` — that conflicted with dblclick-rename and
  click-select. Toggle happens via disclosure arrow area.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: **85/5/0** (up from 75/5/0).
- Typecheck: clean.
- `data-layer-name` round-trip verified via clean-export contract.

### Related

- ADR-034 Layer Tree DnD — rename + context menu shipped; DnD reparent deferred.

---

## [1.1.5] — 2026-04-24 — Phase B4: Layers tree view (ADR-034)

Fifth micro-step of Phase B. Replaces the flat z-order list with a
hierarchical tree following DOM parent-child structure. Siblings inside
each branch remain z-sorted so the stacking intuition is preserved.

### Added

- `editor/src/layers-panel.js`:
  - `buildLayerRowHtml(layer, index, ctx, options)` — extracted shared row
    HTML used by both flat and tree renderers. `options.renderAsSummary`
    picks `<summary>` for details-based hosts; `options.depth` drives left
    indentation via `--layer-depth` CSS var.
  - `buildLayerTree(sortedLayers, slideEl)` — walks each element's DOM
    parent chain until it finds an ancestor in the same set; returns root
    entries.
  - `renderLayerTreeNodes(nodes, depth, ctx)` — recursive render; nested
    branches wrap in `<details open>` + `<summary>`; leaves render as plain
    rows so focus / click / drag bindings stay uniform.
- `editor/styles/layers-region.css`: tree-mode rules — depth indentation,
  custom disclosure arrow that rotates on `<details[open]>`, default-open
  children, hide list marker.
- `tests/playwright/specs/layers-tree-nav.spec.js` — 10 new smoke tests:
  region visibility, `.is-tree-mode` class, depth attr, click-to-select,
  details wrappers, toggle behavior, basic vs advanced control gating,
  visibility button coverage, flag off → flat mode.
- Gate-A expanded to include the new spec → **75 passed / 5 skipped / 0 failed**.

### Changed

- `editor/src/feature-flags.js`: `treeLayers` default flipped `false → true`.
- `editor/src/inspector-sync.js`: when standalone, always attempt render
  — the shell region starts `[hidden]` and was never getting un-hidden
  because the gate required "`!hidden`" (chicken-and-egg).

### Non-breaking

- Flat-mode fallback retained: `window.featureFlags.treeLayers = false;
  renderLayersPanel()` reverts to the flat list instantly.
- Gate-A: **75/5/0** (up from 65/5/0 — 10 new tree-nav tests, no regressions).
- Typecheck: clean.

- ADR-034 Layer Tree DnD — tree-rendering half shipped (DnD reparent deferred)

## [1.1.4] — 2026-04-23 — Phase B3: Flip defaults to v2 layout (first visible UX change)

Fourth micro-step of Phase B — first user-visible UX change in the v2
redesign trajectory. Flips `layoutVersion` default from `"v1"` to `"v2"`
and `layersStandalone` default from `false` to `true`. Gate-A: 65/5/0.

### Changed

- `editor/src/feature-flags.js`: DEFAULT_FLAGS
  - `layoutVersion: "v1"` → `"v2"`
  - `layersStandalone: false` → `true`
- `editor/src/layers-panel.js`: `renderLayersPanel()` now renders in basic
  mode when `layersStandalone` is true (V2-01 invariant: layers visible in
  both basic + advanced modes). Advanced-only controls (drag handle,
  z-index input, lock button, "Заблокирован" chip) hidden in basic mode.
- `editor/src/inspector-sync.js`: host-aware render gate now allows basic
  mode when `layersStandalone`, so selection-change highlight stays fresh.

### UX impact

- New users: Figma-style split-pane left column with persistent Layers
  panel below the slide rail. Layers visible in basic mode (view+visibility
  toggle) and advanced mode (+ drag-reorder, z-index, lock).
- Existing users (with localStorage persisted from v1.1.0–v1.1.3): flags
  stay on v1 per their stored prefs. They can reset via
  `window.resetFeatureFlags()` in devtools.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: **65/5/0** preserved — CSS rule hides `#layersInspectorSection`
  when `[data-layers-standalone="true"]`, so existing `toBeHidden()`
  assertions still pass.
- Typecheck: clean.

## [1.1.3] — 2026-04-23 — Phase B2: #layersRegion shell region + dual-render

Third micro-step of Phase B. Adds the persistent Layers shell region scaffold
and dual-render placement logic. Defaults remain v1 — zero UX change until
v1.1.4 flips them.

### Added

- `presentation-editor.html`: wraps `#slidesPanel` in `<div class="left-pane-wrapper">`, adds `<button class="left-pane-resizer">` (already DOM-expected by left-pane-splitter.js), and adds `<aside id="layersRegion" class="panel shell-panel shell-panel-left layers-region" hidden>` with internal `.layers-region-body` container.
- `editor/src/layers-panel.js`:
  - `ensureLayersContainerPlacement()` — moves the single `#layersListContainer` DOM node between `.layers-region-body` (when `featureFlags.layersStandalone` true) and `#layersInspectorSection` (default). Single node avoids duplicated IDs + event rebinds.
  - `getActiveLayersHost()` — resolves either `#layersRegion` or `#layersInspectorSection` per flag.
  - `syncInactiveLayersHost()` — hides the non-owning host so stale `hidden` state can't leak after a runtime flag flip.
  - `renderLayersPanel()` now delegates visibility to the active host, not hardcoded to inspector section.
- `editor/src/state.js`: `els.layersRegion` reference added.
- `editor/src/boot.js`: `init()` calls `ensureLayersContainerPlacement()` after `applyLayersStandaloneAttribute()` — before first paint.
- `editor/src/inspector-sync.js`: render-skip predicate uses active host, not hardcoded inspector section (so standalone mode still triggers renders).
- `editor/styles/layers-region.css`: activated scaffold — flex layout with scrolling `.layers-region-body`, header pinned, padded list container.

### Non-breaking

- **Zero UX change** — `featureFlags.layersStandalone` defaults to `false`, so `getActiveLayersHost()` returns the inspector section exactly as before; `#layersRegion` stays `hidden`; new `.left-pane-wrapper` is transparent in v1 layout (no split-pane rules apply).
- Gate-A: **65/5/0** preserved.
- Typecheck: clean.

### Manual activation (for testing)

```js
window.featureFlags.layersStandalone = true;
window.featureFlags.layoutVersion = "v2";
// reload — layers panel renders in the shell region below slides rail.
```

## [1.1.2] — 2026-04-23 — Docs: V2 Continuation Prompt

Docs-only patch. No code changes. No UX change.

### Added

- `docs/V2-CONTINUATION-PROMPT.md` — comprehensive copy-paste prompt for
  continuing the v2.0 redesign in a fresh agent session. Applies
  Role-Task-Context-Constraints-Examples-StopCriteria prompt engineering
  pattern. Includes:
  - Mandatory context-load order (6 files)
  - Baseline verification commands with expected outputs per release
  - Execution loop structure (13 steps per logical unit)
  - All invariants from MASTERPLAN §1 enumerated inline
  - Positive + negative examples (follows rhythm / skips phases /
    skips verification / batches commits / uses `git add .` /
    vault-writes-without-skill)
  - Stop conditions (when to halt and report to user)
  - Success criteria checklist for v2.0.0 done-ness
  - Behavioral guidelines cross-linking CLAUDE.md + AGENT-SYSTEM-INSTRUCTION
  - Quick-reference cheat sheet
  - Self-test instructions for verifying the prompt works
  - Prompt engineering rationale (patterns applied)
- `docs/V2-MASTERPLAN.md` §10: short inline version retained + link to
  V2-CONTINUATION-PROMPT.md as canonical.

### Non-breaking

- Gate-A: 65/5/0 preserved (no code touched).
- Typecheck: clean.

### Purpose

Ensures continuity across multiple agent sessions. Any fresh session can
load context identically and resume mid-phase without drift in invariants,
commit rhythm, or vault discipline.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-23 — Phase B1: Split-pane scaffold (dormant)

Second micro-step of Phase B. Scaffolds the Figma-style split-pane layout
behind `ui.layoutVersion === "v2"` feature flag. Default off — zero UX change.

### Added

- `editor/styles/split-pane.css` — full v2 layout rules, scoped to `body[data-layout-version="v2"]`. Contains grid definitions for `.left-pane-wrapper`, `.left-pane-resizer` (with :hover / :focus-visible / .is-dragging states), responsive fallback < 1024px.
- `editor/src/left-pane-splitter.js` — resizer JS with pointer drag, keyboard arrows (Arrow Up/Down step 2%, Shift 10%, Home/End, Enter/Space reset), double-click reset, `role="separator"`, `aria-valuenow/min/max`, localStorage persistence. No-op when flag off.
- `editor/src/shell-layout.js`: `applyLayoutVersionAttribute()` and `applyLayersStandaloneAttribute()` helpers — mirror flag values to `<body data-layout-version>` / `<body data-layers-standalone>` so CSS scoping works on first paint.
- `editor/src/boot.js`: `init()` calls body-attribute helpers before first paint and `initLeftPaneSplitter()` after `bindShellLayout()`.
- `@layer` declaration: `split-pane` layer appended (after `modal`, before `responsive`).
- `presentation-editor.html`: link `split-pane.css`, script `left-pane-splitter.js`.

### Non-breaking

- **Zero UX change** — `ui.layoutVersion` defaults to `"v1"`, so `body[data-layout-version="v1"]` → no v2 CSS rules match → layout identical to v1.1.0.
- Gate-A: 65/5/0 preserved.

### Activation

- Manual (advanced users): set `window.featureFlags.layoutVersion = "v2"` + `window.featureFlags.layersStandalone = true` in devtools, reload. Splitter activates (requires `.left-pane-wrapper` in DOM — comes in v1.1.2).
- Default flip: v1.1.3 (Phase B3).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-23 — Phase A Foundation (v2.0 Redesign trajectory start)

**First milestone on the path v1.0.3 → v2.0.0.** Foundation release — zero UX change, all changes additive. Sets up tokens, feature flags, CSS layer, and 7 new ADRs for the next 4 phases.

### Added (Architecture / Docs)

- **7 new ADRs** (031–037) covering the full v2.0 redesign scope:
  - ADR-031 Persistent Layers Panel — extract layers from inspector into shell region
  - ADR-032 Workspace Layout v2 — Figma-style split-pane (slides/layers left column)
  - ADR-033 Theme System v3 — elevation, SVG icons, motion hierarchy, focus-ring
  - ADR-034 Layer Tree DnD — hierarchical tree view, drag-drop reparent, group/ungroup
  - ADR-035 Smart Import Pipeline v2 — 8 framework detectors, 4 slide inference strategies, complexity score, preprocessing report
  - ADR-036 PPTX Fidelity v2 — getBoundingClientRect position resolver, SVG shapes, gradients, font map, validator
  - ADR-037 UX Progressive Disclosure — contextual sections, error layers 4-6, destructive-action confirm, onboarding v2
- Updated vault: `PROJ - v2.x Redesign`, `ARCH - Overview` (module/CSS trajectory, feature flags registry)

### Added (Code — additive only)

- **tokens v3** in `editor/styles/tokens.css`:
  - Elevation system: `--elevation-0..4` with light + dark rebinds
  - Semantic shadows: `--shadow-panel`, `--shadow-floating`, `--shadow-modal`, `--shadow-pressed`
  - Hover/active strong states: `--state-hover-strong`, strengthened `--state-active`
  - Motion hierarchy: `--motion-micro` (120ms), `--motion-base` (180ms), `--motion-emphasis` (280ms)
  - Easings: `--ease-out`, `--ease-in-out`, `--ease-spring`
  - Left-pane split reservation: `--left-split`, `--left-resizer-thickness`, `--left-resizer-hover`
- `editor/src/feature-flags.js` — extended with v2 flags: `layoutVersion`, `layersStandalone`, `treeLayers`, `multiSelect`, `pptxV2`, `smartImport`, `svgIcons`. All default to off/v1 in this release.
- `editor/styles/layers-region.css` — empty scaffold; added `layers-region` to `@layer` declaration in `tokens.css`.

### Non-breaking

- **Zero UX difference** from v1.0.3. All additions are dormant (behind flags default off).
- **Gate-A: 65/5/0** preserved.
- No `type="module"` introduced (ADR-015 preserved).
- iframe + bridge + modelDoc architecture untouched.

### Planned next (Phase B → v1.2.0)

- Activate persistent layers region (`ui.layersStandalone = true`)
- Activate 4-zone layout (`ui.layoutVersion = "v2"`)
- Implement Smart Import Pipeline v2 (`import-pipeline-v2/` module)
- Tree-view layer hierarchy with DnD
- Playwright: `layers-panel-v2.spec.js`, `import-pipeline-v2.spec.js`

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-22 — pointer-events Regression Fix

### Fixed
- **bridge-script.js** `ensureHelperStyles()`: removed `pointer-events:auto!important` from the `_deckHasOwnVisibility=true` branch of `_slideEditCss`. Deck's own CSS (`.slide{pointer-events:none} .slide.active{pointer-events:all}`) now manages pointer-events correctly.
- **v1.0.2 regression**: with own-visibility decks (e.g. `prepodovai_v3_edit.html`), all non-active invisible slides (opacity:0) had `pointer-events:auto` and intercepted every click intended for the active slide. Confirmed via Playwright: 8 invisible click-interceptors per deck.
- Own-visibility branch now only injects `transition:none!important; animation:none!important` (race-condition protection). No-own-visibility branch unchanged.

### Tests
- Updated `foreign-deck-compat.spec.js` Test C in all 3 suites: assertion changed from "all slides have pointer-events:auto" → "exactly 1 interactive slide" (the active one). The previous assertion was validating the bug. foreign-deck: 17/17 ✅. Full Gate-A: 82/5/0 ✅.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-22 — Foreign Deck Single-Slide View Fix

### Fixed
- **bridge-script.js** `fix(compat)`: `ensureHelperStyles()` now detects whether the foreign deck manages its own slide visibility via class toggles (`.active`, `.present`, `.past`/`.future`, `aria-current`, `hidden`, `aria-hidden`).
  - When own visibility detected: only `pointer-events:auto!important; transition:none!important; animation:none!important` is injected — deck's native single-slide navigation is preserved
  - When no own visibility detected: full `opacity:1!important; transform:none!important` override still applies
  - **Fixes**: `prepodovai_v3_edit.html` and similar `position:absolute` overlay decks showing all slides simultaneously and overlapping in edit mode

### Tests
- Updated `foreign-deck-compat.spec.js` Test B (all 3 foreign suites): assertion changed from "all slides opacity > 0.9" → "exactly 1 slide visible (deck manages visibility)" — all 17 tests passing (17/17 ✅)

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-22 — Foreign Deck Compatibility

### Fixed
- **bridge-script.js** `fix(bridge)`: CSS overrides injected via `ensureHelperStyles()` for foreign HTML presentations in edit mode.
  - `[data-editor-slide-id]` → `opacity:1; pointer-events:auto; transform:none; transition:none; animation:none` (`!important`) — all import-pipeline-tagged slides forced visible, no transitions
  - `.fragment` → `opacity:1; transform:none; transition:none; animation:none` — reveal-like fragments fully visible in edit mode
  - `.stack > section` → `display:block; position:relative; transition:none; animation:none` — vertical sub-slides unfolded
  - `stopPropagation()` on ArrowKey/Space/PageDown/PageUp in `keydown` handler — blocks deck-native slide navigation when in edit mode and not in inline text editing
- Targets only `[data-editor-slide-id]` elements (tagged by import pipeline) — own-format decks unaffected (regression test confirms)

### Tests
- Added 3 stress test fixtures: `ops_control_room_stress.html`, `mercury_casefile_stress.html`, `reveal_like_nested_stress.html`
- Added `tests/playwright/specs/foreign-deck-compat.spec.js` — 17 tests / 4 suites covering viewport-flat and reveal-like nested deck structures (17/17 ✅)

## [v0.29.5] — 2026-04-21 — W4 batch 6 (FINAL): WO-23 feedback.js split → surface-manager + banners scaffold

### Refactor
- refactor(arch): split feedback.js → surface-manager.js + banners.js scaffold — PAIN-MAP **P2-09 CLOSED**; P1-09 partially closed (full banner migration deferred post-v1.0). `surface-manager.js` (37 LOC): 2 functions cut/pasted verbatim from feedback.js (`normalizeShellSurfaceKeep`, `closeTransientShellUi`) with ZERO body edits. Runtime guard: throws if `closeContextMenu` not yet defined (enforces load-after-context-menu.js). `banners.js` (97 LOC scaffold): `BANNER_REGISTRY` (Object.create(null)); `@typedef BannerSpec` with required `.render(payload)` + optional `.hide()`; `registerBanner(id, spec)` — throws on missing render; `showBanner(id, payload)` — calls spec.render, replaces existing activeBanners entry (no duplicate), updates `window.store.update('ui', {activeBanners})`, falls back to `reportShellWarning` for unknown id; `hideBanner(id)` — calls optional spec.hide, filters activeBanners; `getActiveBanners()` — returns frozen copy. Runtime guard: throws if `window.store.get` not a function. WO-07 Trust Banner wired separately via shellBoundary (path b — already merged v0.27.3). `state.js`: ui slice extended with `activeBanners: []` initial value. `feedback.js`: moved block replaced with 2-line comment (`// Surface mutex moved to surface-manager.js (WO-23 — PAIN-MAP P1-09, P2-09).`). Script load order: `context-menu.js` → `inspector-sync.js` → `shell-overlays.js` → `surface-manager.js` → `banners.js` → `theme.js`. Call-site audit: `closeTransientShellUi` called in `boot.js` (1), `bridge-commands.js` (2), `selection.js` (1), `shell-layout.js` (3), `shell-overlays.js` (3); `normalizeShellSurfaceKeep` called in `shell-layout.js` (1), `feedback.js` (removed). All resolve via shared global scope — no imports added. feedback.js: 1237 LOC (was 1260). Module count: 30 → 32. Gate-A: 59/5/0. test:unit: 54/54.

### Tests
- test(arch): surface-manager.spec.js — 5 unit cases. Cases: (a) keep:'context-menu' skips context-menu closer, (b) normalizeShellSurfaceKeep(undefined) → empty Set, (c) normalizeShellSurfaceKeep('x') → Set{x}, (d) normalizeShellSurfaceKeep(['a','b',null]) → Set{a,b} (null filtered), (e) no-options closes all 6 surfaces.
- test(arch): banners.spec.js — 6 unit cases. Cases: (a) registerBanner stores spec, (b) showBanner calls render + updates activeBanners, (c) hideBanner removes from active list, (d) unknown id does not throw — calls reportShellWarning, (e) duplicate showBanner replaces entry, (f) missing render throws. test:unit → 54/54.

## [v0.29.4] — 2026-04-21 — W4 batch 5: WO-22 boot.js split → theme + zoom + shell-layout

### Refactor
- refactor(arch): split boot.js → theme.js + zoom.js + shell-layout.js (~440 LOC extracted). main.js orphan DOM reparent absorbed into boot.js::ensureSlideTemplateBarRoot — **PAIN-MAP P1-08 CLOSED**. P1-07 partially closed (remaining boot.js concerns deferred post-v1.0). `theme.js` (~153 LOC): 8 functions moved verbatim (`resolveSystemTheme`, `getThemePreferenceLabel`, `queueThemeTransitionUnlock`, `syncThemeDatasets`, `applyResolvedTheme`, `initTheme`, `setThemePreference`, `toggleTheme`). Runtime guard: throws if `window.store.get` not a function. `zoom.js` (~89 LOC): 5 functions moved verbatim (`initPreviewZoom`, `setPreviewZoom`, `applyPreviewZoom`, `updatePreviewZoomUi`, `stepZoom`). Runtime guard: throws if `window.store.get` not a function. `shell-layout.js` (~206 LOC): 11 functions moved verbatim (`setToggleButtonState`, `setDisclosureButtonState`, `bindShellLayout`, `isCompactShell`, `syncShellPanelFocusableState`, `setElementInertState`, `applyShellPanelState`, `syncShellPanelVisibility`, `setShellPanelState`, `toggleShellPanel`, `closeShellPanels`). Runtime guard: throws if `state` or `els` not defined. Script load order: `shell-overlays.js` → `theme.js` → `zoom.js` → `shell-layout.js` → `boot.js` → `primary-action.js` → `main.js`. All callers in `boot.js`, `bridge-commands.js`, `context-menu.js`, `dom.js`, `feedback.js`, `floating-toolbar.js`, `primary-action.js`, `selection.js`, `shell-overlays.js`, `shortcuts.js` resolve via shared global scope. boot.js: ~1551 LOC (was 1973). main.js: 3 LOC (was 12). Module count: 27 → 30. Gate-A: 59/5/0. test:unit: 43/43. PAIN-MAP: P1-07 (partial), P1-08 (CLOSED).

---

## [v0.29.3] — 2026-04-21 — W4 batch 4: WO-21 selection.js split → floating-toolbar.js

### Refactor
- refactor(arch): split selection.js → floating-toolbar.js (198 LOC extracted) + toolbar.js (54 LOC extracted); **PAIN-MAP P1-06 CLOSED**. `floating-toolbar.js` (267 LOC): 6 functions moved verbatim from selection.js (`toggleFloatingToolbarCollapsed`, `persistToolbarSession`, `initFloatingToolbarState`, `clampToolbarPosition`, `positionFloatingToolbar`, `hideFloatingToolbar`) + 1 function moved verbatim from toolbar.js (`updateFloatingToolbarContext`). Runtime guard: throws if `getSelectionInteractionRect` not yet defined (enforces load order). Script load order: `selection.js` → `layers-panel.js` → `floating-toolbar.js` → `toolbar.js`. `toolbar.js` retains only inspector-init helpers (`initInspectorSections`, `addInspectorHelpBadges`, `slugify`). selection.js now ~1171 LOC. toolbar.js now 96 LOC (was 152). Module count: 26 → 27. Gate-A: 59/5/0. test:unit: 43/43. PAIN-MAP: P1-06 (final closure).

---

## [v0.29.2] — 2026-04-21 — W4 batch 3: WO-20 selection.js split → layers-panel.js

### Refactor
- refactor(arch): split selection.js → layers-panel.js (449 LOC extracted; PAIN-MAP P1-06 phase 1/2). Do NOT claim P1-06 closed — WO-21 is next. 18 functions moved verbatim (zero body edits): `toggleLayerLock`, `toggleLayerVisibility`, `reorderLayers`, `getEntityKindIcon`, `getLayerLabel`, `getPreviewLayerNode`, `isLayerSessionHidden`, `setLayerSessionVisibility`, `clearSessionOnlyVisibilityFromModelNode`, `stripSessionOnlyVisibilityFromReplacement`, `getRussianPlural`, `formatLayerStackHint`, `buildLayerStatusChipHtml`, `buildLayerStatusChipsHtml`, `renderLayersPanel`, `bindLayersPanelActions`, `groupSelectedElements`, `ungroupSelectedElement`. `layers-panel.js` runtime guard: throws if `renderSelectionOverlay` not yet defined (enforces load order). All call sites in `bridge-commands.js`, `context-menu.js`, `dom.js`, `feedback.js`, `history.js`, `inspector-sync.js`, `shell-overlays.js` resolve via shared global scope — no imports added. Script load order: `selection.js` → `layers-panel.js` → `toolbar.js`. Module count: 25 → 26. Gate-A: 59/5/0. test:unit: 43/43. PAIN-MAP: P1-06 (phase 1/2).

## [v0.29.1] — 2026-04-21 — W4 batch 2: WO-19 RAF-coalesce selection fan-out

### Performance
- perf(render): RAF-coalesce selection fan-out — ADR-013 §Render coalescing — PAIN-MAP P0-12, P1-12. `state.js` (+180 LOC): `SELECTION_RENDER_KEYS` frozen object (8 keys: inspector, shellSurface, floatingToolbar, overlay, slideRail, refreshUi, overlapDetection, focusKeyboard); `state.selectionRenderPending` dirty-flag map (all false by default); `state.selectionRenderRafId` (0 = no frame queued); `state.selectionRenderOptions` (previousNodeId guard). `scheduleSelectionRender(keys, options)`: accepts `'all'` or `string[]` of key names; marks dirty flags; enqueues exactly 1 `requestAnimationFrame(flushSelectionRender)` if not already queued — N synchronous calls → 1 RAF. `flushSelectionRender()`: snapshots all 8 flags, zeros them BEFORE sub-renders execute (prevents double-flush race), zeros `selectionRenderRafId`, runs sub-renders in deterministic order (1-inspector, 2-shellSurface, 3-floatingToolbar, 4-overlay, 5-slideRail, 6-refreshUi, 7-overlapDetection, 8-focusKeyboard), each wrapped in try/catch → `reportShellWarning` so a throwing sub-render does not block others. focusKeyboard gated: only fires when previousNodeId !== selectedNodeId OR !isTextEditing. `bridge-commands.js`: `applyElementSelection` — 7 synchronous sub-render calls replaced with `scheduleSelectionRender('all', {previousNodeId})` inside existing `store.batch`. `applySelectionGeometry` — 3 synchronous calls replaced with `scheduleSelectionRender(['floatingToolbar','inspector','overlay'])`. `clearSelectedElementState` — 2-call cluster replaced with `scheduleSelectionRender(['inspector','overlay'])`. Element-update block — 4-call cluster replaced with `scheduleSelectionRender('all')` or `scheduleSelectionRender(['slideRail','refreshUi','overlapDetection'])` based on `isCurrentSelection`. `inspector-sync.js` P1-12: `renderLayersPanel()` wrapped: `if (state.complexityMode==='advanced' && els.layersInspectorSection && !els.layersInspectorSection.hidden)` — basic mode and hidden section skip renderLayersPanel entirely. Pre-WO-19 baseline: 7 synchronous render passes per click, multiple `getBoundingClientRect` + style-write interleaves. Post-WO-19: 1 RAF per click coalescing all 7-8 renders into one animation frame. Gate-A: 59/5/0. ADR-013. PAIN-MAP: P0-12, P1-12.

### Tests
- test(render): schedule-selection-render.spec.js — 11 unit cases (Node --test runner). Cases: (a) two calls → 1 RAF, (b) flush calls 8 sub-renders in documented order, (c) subset key schedules only that sub-render, (d) re-scheduling during flush enqueues new RAF, (e) dirty flags zeroed before sub-renders execute, (f) focusKeyboard fires when not text-editing even if same node, (f2) focusKeyboard NOT called when same node + isTextEditing, (g) throwing sub-render does not block others, (h) rafId zeroed after flush, (i) 3 combined calls coalesce to 1 RAF with union of keys, (j) P1-12 renderLayersPanel guard. test:unit → 43/43 (32 existing + 11 new).
- test(render): selection-perf.spec.js — 3 Playwright gate-B cases on perf-100elem.html fixture (100 deterministic elements, 2 slides). (A) N scheduleSelectionRender calls → exactly 1 RAF enqueued; (B) flushSelectionRender executes within 2 animation frames (< 200 ms E2E budget); (C) 5 synchronous schedule calls → 1 pending RAF with combined dirty flags.
- fixture: tests/fixtures/perf-100elem.html — 100 deterministic elements (elem-001..elem-100), 2 slides (50 elements each), absolute-positioned grid layout, no random data.

## [v0.29.0] — 2026-04-21 — W3 Bridge v2+Store batch 3: WO-18 History Slice + Patch Engine

### History
- feat(history): patch-based snapshots + history budget chip — ADR-013 §history slice — WO-18. `history.js` (+254 LOC): `HISTORY_CLIENT_ID` stable per-session random ID via `crypto.getRandomValues` / `Math.random` fallback; `_historyPatchCounter` monotonically increasing (ADR-017 CRDT-readiness). `fnv1a32(str)` — FNV-1a 32-bit hash (synchronous, no crypto.subtle) for HTML deduplication: identical HTML skipped without disk/memory write. `createDomPatch(html, reason, currentPatches)` — produces `{op:'baseline'|'delta', html, diff?, hash, clientId, counter, at, reason}`. Baseline rolled on first commit and every 10th delta since last baseline. Delta stores `diff: JSON.stringify({nextHtml})` plus full `html` fallback (ADR-017 §no-replay). `captureHistorySnapshot` rewritten: reads from `window.store.get('history')` (immutable), trims forward-redo branch, dedup via hash, calls `createDomPatch`, enforces `HISTORY_LIMIT=20` via `slice(-20)`, emits single `window.store.batch(...)` update, mirrors to legacy `state.history` / `state.historyIndex` for backward compat, shows Russian warning toast on overflow: "Старейший шаг истории сброшен. Сохрани проект, чтобы не потерять работу.". `restoreSnapshot` updated: handles both `op:'baseline'` (direct html), `op:'delta'` (parse diff.nextHtml, fallback to html), and legacy object shape. `undo()`/`redo()` now read from `window.store.get('history')` and emit `store.update` in addition to legacy state mirror. `captureHistorySnapshot`, `serializeCurrentProject`, `restoreSnapshot` removed from `export.js` (WO-18: moved to history.js global scope). `state.js`: `window.store.defineSlice('history', {index:-1,limit:20,baseline:null,patches:[],dirty:false,lastSavedAt:0})`; Proxy shim extended with `_HISTORY_STATE_TO_SLICE` map (historyIndex/dirty/lastSavedAt); `els.historyBudgetChip` cached. `store.js`: `@typedef HistoryPatch` + `@typedef HistorySlice` with ADR-017 CRDT-readiness checklist. `primary-action.js`: `renderHistoryBudgetChip()` reads `histSlice.patches.length` → hidden if <5, shows `N/20` text + `aria-label`, adds `.is-warning` at ≥15, `.is-danger` at ≥19; subscribed to 'history' slice. `layout.css`: `.history-budget-chip` + `.is-warning` + `.is-danger` styles inside `@layer layout`. `presentation-editor.html`: `<span id="historyBudgetChip">` in `#topbarStateCluster` with `role="status" aria-live="polite"`. CommonJS export guard in history.js exports `fnv1a32`, `createDomPatch`, `getHistoryClientId` for Node test runner. Gate-A: 59/5/0. ADR-013. ADR-017. PAIN-MAP: P0-09.

### Tests
- test(history): history-patches.spec.js — 12 unit cases (Node --test runner). Cases: (a) first-baseline, (b) hash-dedup, (c) 11th-rolls-baseline, (d) HISTORY_LIMIT overflow, (e) baseline-restore, (f) delta-restore, (g) clientId-stable, (h) counter-monotonic, (i) undo-store, (j) redo-store, (k) fnv1a32-deterministic, (l) 20-identical-dedup-1-baseline-<50KB. test:unit → 32/32 (12 store + 8 selection + 12 history).
- test(history): history-budget.spec.js — 2 Playwright gate-B cases: (A) 15 snapshots → chip shows "15/20" with .is-warning; (B) 21 snapshots → overflow toast "Старейший шаг истории сброшен." visible + chip shows "20/20" with .is-danger.

## [v0.28.5] — 2026-04-21 — W3 Bridge v2+Store batch 2: WO-17 Selection Slice

### State
- refactor(store): selection slice migration — 16 selection fields migrated from window.state to store 'selection' slice — ADR-013 phase 2 — PAIN-MAP P2-07 (closure table). `store.js`: `@typedef SelectionSlice` covering all 16 fields with ADR-017 CRDT-readiness checklist. `state.js`: `window.store.defineSlice('selection', {...})` with full initial shape including flags/policy objects. `createDefaultSelectionPolicy` refactored: 6-branch if-chain replaced with `SELECTION_POLICY_TABLE` + priority-order loop — output shape byte-identical for all flag combinations; Russian reason strings preserved verbatim. Proxy shim extended: `_SELECTION_STATE_TO_SLICE` map (16 entries) added alongside existing `_UI_SLICE_KEYS` — reads route to `store.get('selection')[sliceKey]`, writes dual-write to store + raw state for backward compat. `bridge-commands.js` `applyElementSelection`: 3-phase refactor — (1) compute all values, (2) dual-write raw state fields + `window.store.batch(() => store.update('selection', fullPatch))` for ONE microtask notification per selection event, (3) side-effect calls in identical order. No DOM nodes stored in slice (IDs + plain objects only). Zero bundler deps added. Gate-A: 59/5/0. ADR-013. ADR-017. PAIN-MAP: P2-07.

### Tests
- test(state): selection-slice.spec.js — 8 unit cases (Node --test runner). Cases: defineSlice-initial, update-next-prev, batch-fires-once, policy-slide-root, policy-table-priority, policy-golden-object, policy-free-defaults, select-entityKind-initial. test:unit → 20/20 (12 store + 8 selection).

---

## [v0.28.4] — 2026-04-21 — W3 Bridge v2+Store batch 2: WO-16 Observable Store

### State
- feat(state): observable store bootstrap + ui slice migration — ADR-013 phase 1 — PAIN-MAP P0-09 start. `store.js` (+340 LOC): hand-rolled `createStore()` IIFE factory on `window.store`; API: `defineSlice/get/select/update/subscribe/batch`. `Object.freeze` slices in dev, `queueMicrotask`-based notification, microtask coalescing — subscribers fire exactly once per batch. `@typedef UISlice` + `@typedef Store` per ADR-011. `window.store.defineSlice("ui", {complexityMode,previewZoom,theme,themePreference})` in `state.js` before state literal. `window.stateProxy` Proxy shim: `get` reads ui keys from store; `set` writes ui keys through `store.update`. `boot.js` rewired: `applyResolvedTheme`/`setThemePreference`/`setComplexityMode`/`setPreviewZoom` each call `window.store.update("ui", {...})` to keep store in sync. Zero DOM references in `store.js`. Zero bundler deps. `test:unit` → 12/12 (`tests/unit/store.spec.js`). ADR-013 Status → Accepted (phase 1). Gate-A: 59/5/0. ADR-013. PAIN-MAP: P0-09.

### Tests
- test(state): store.spec.js — 12 unit cases (Node --test runner). Cases: get-frozen, update-identity, subscribe-next-prev, microtask-fire, batch-coalesce, path-subscribe, defineSlice+subscribe, sequential-coalesce, freeze-throw, unsubscribe, nested-batch, select-missing.

---

## [v0.28.3] — 2026-04-21 — W3 Bridge v2+Store batch 2: WO-13 Schema Validators

### Bridge
- feat(bridge): per-message schema validators + KNOWN_ENTITY_KINDS injection — ADR-012 §2 — PAIN-MAP P2-05. `bridge-schema.js` (+694 LOC): validators for all ~30 message types; `validateMessage()` public entry. `sendToBridge` in `bridge-commands.js` gates every outgoing message through `BRIDGE_SCHEMA.validateMessage` — invalid payloads dropped with diagnostic. `CANONICAL_ENTITY_KINDS_ARR` in `constants.js` is now single source of truth for entity kind strings (P2-05 closed): `bridge-script.js` KNOWN_ENTITY_KINDS injected via `${JSON.stringify(CANONICAL_ENTITY_KINDS_ARR)}` in template literal; `bridge-commands.js` CANONICAL_ENTITY_KINDS built from same constant. `BRIDGE_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES = 262144` added to constants. `bridge-script.js`: `postAck(refSeq, ok, code, msg)` function + ack emissions inside replace-node-html/replace-slide-html handlers. `bridge.js` case `"ack"` collects structured acks in `state.bridgeAcks` Map keyed by refSeq. Direction fix: `slide-rail.js` `navigateSelectedTableCell` changed from `"next"/"previous"` to `"tab"/"shift-tab"`; `bridge-schema.js` VALID_DIRECTIONS updated to include `"shift-tab"`; `bridge-script.js` `navigateTableCellByDirection` step handles both `"previous"` and `"shift-tab"`. Fixes Gate-A regression in S9 Tab/Shift+Tab table navigation. WO-16 foundation bundled (store.js + state.js store guard). gate-contract: 152/0. Gate-A: 59/5/0. ADR-012. PAIN-MAP: P2-05.

---

## [v0.28.2] — 2026-04-21 — W3 Bridge v2+Store batch 1: WO-15 Telemetry

### Telemetry
- feat(telemetry): opt-in local scaffold + toggle UI — ADR-020 scaffold — WO-15. `editor/src/telemetry.js` IIFE: `window.telemetry` (isEnabled/setEnabled/emit/readLog/clearLog/exportLogJson). 1 MB + 5000-event LRU cap with oldest-first eviction. Crypto-secure UUID via `crypto.randomUUID()` with `crypto.getRandomValues()` fallback. Zero network calls (no fetch/XHR/sendBeacon). Default OFF — `localStorage['editor:telemetry:enabled']` must be "1" to enable. Disable clears log. Canary event `{level:"ok",code:"telemetry.enabled"}` emitted on off→on transition. Toggle UI in advanced diagnostics panel (`#telemetryToggle`, `#telemetryExportBtn`, `#telemetryClearBtn`) with Russian copy ("Записывать действия в локальный журнал для себя", "Экспорт журнала", "Очистить"). Export via `URL.createObjectURL` + `<a download>` — no server round-trip. `bindTelemetryToggleUi()` in `feedback.js`, wired from `boot.js init()`. `TELEMETRY_ENABLED_KEY`, `TELEMETRY_LOG_KEY`, `TELEMETRY_MAX_BYTES`, `TELEMETRY_MAX_EVENTS` added to `constants.js`. Toggle row styling added to `editor/styles/inspector.css` (existing `@layer inspector`). 6-test `telemetry.spec.js` (not Gate-A). Gate-A: 59/5/0. ADR-020 Status → Accepted (scaffold).

## [v0.28.1] — 2026-04-21 — W3 Bridge v2+Store batch 1: WO-14 Types

### Types
- chore(types): bootstrap tsconfig + JSDoc on state/constants/bridge — ADR-011 partial — P1-18. `tsconfig.json` (noEmit, checkJs, strict, ES2022, 3-file include: state.js + constants.js + bridge.js). `typescript@^5.4.0` devDep. `test:gate-types` script (exits 0, additive — not in Gate-A). `editor/src/globals.d.ts` ambient declarations for cross-script globals. `State` @typedef with 10 sub-typedefs (SelectionFlags, SelectionPolicy, SlideRailDrag, LayersPanelDragState, SelectionTooltip, SelectionRect, ActiveGuides, PreviewAssetAuditCounts, ToolbarDragOffset) covering all 80+ state fields. `BridgeMessageEvent` @typedef + payload stubs. `@type {Set<string>}` on 7 Set constants. `@typedef` + `@type` on 4 Object.freeze constants (STARTER_DECKS, SANDBOX_MODES, TRUST_DETECTION_SELECTORS, TRUST_DECISION_KEYS). `@param`/`@returns` on createDefaultSelectionPolicy, normalizeSelectionPolicy, setPreviewLifecycleState. Inline null-safety fix: els.previewFrame cast to HTMLIFrameElement. Error-unknown fix in catch block. Gate-A: 59/5/0. New gate: test:gate-types (optional, exits 0). ADR-011. PAIN-MAP: P1-18.

## [v0.28.0] — 2026-04-21 — W3 Bridge v2+Store batch 1: WO-12 Bridge hello

### Bridge
- feat(bridge): v2 hello handshake + mismatch banner — ADR-012 partial — P0-10 start. `bridge-schema.js` `validateHello` updated: `protocol` is now a numeric `2` (not a string). `bridge.js` case `"hello"` added before `case "bridge-ready"`: validates payload via `BRIDGE_SCHEMA.validateMessage`, sets `state.bridgeProtocolVersion=2` and `state.bridgeBuild` on success, or sets `state.editingSupported=false` and shows Russian error toast "Несовместимый bridge: shell ожидает протокол v2, iframe прислал vN. Превью переведено в режим только для чтения." on protocol mismatch. `bridge-script.js` now emits `post('hello', {protocol:2, build:SHELL_BUILD, capabilities:[...]})` before `post('bridge-ready')`. `constants.js` gains `BRIDGE_PROTOCOL_VERSION=2` and `SHELL_BUILD='v0.28.0'`. Existing fixture F-01/F-02 updated to numeric protocol. 3-test contract spec green. Gate-A: 59/5/0. ADR-012. PAIN-MAP: P0-10.

---

## [v0.27.5] — 2026-04-21 — W2 Sandbox+A11y CLOSED (WO-06..11)

### Accessibility
- feat(a11y): rail keyboard nav (↑/↓, Alt+↑/↓) + focus-trap audit — P0-05 / P0-08. Roving tabindex on slide rail (exactly one slide-item has tabindex=0 at any time). ArrowDown/ArrowUp cycles focus between rail items without activating the slide. Alt+ArrowDown/Alt+ArrowUp reorders the focused slide and emits Russian toast "Слайд перемещён: позиция N → M". shortcuts.js arrow-nudge gated on #slidesPanel source so rail ArrowDown does not nudge the preview element. Focus-visible ring tokens (--focus-ring-color, --focus-ring-width) added to tokens.css for both light and dark themes; preview.css :focus-visible rule updated to use tokens. ADR-006, WO-10.

### Tests
- test(a11y): contrast ratio assertions — ADR-006 complete — P0-14. Pure JS WCAG 2.1 contrastRatio helper (sRGB linearization, zero deps). Sentinel checks (black/white=21:1, white/white=1:1, #333/#fff≈12.63). 7 token pairs × 2 themes = 14 assertions: --shell-text/--shell-bg, --on-accent/--shell-accent, success/warning/danger banners on --shell-panel, --shell-text/--shell-panel-soft. All 14 pairs pass WCAG AA (≥4.5:1) — no triaging required. ADR-006 Status → Accepted. Gate-A: 59/5/0.
- Bridge schema registry + contract scaffold — 15-fixture test corpus covering happy-path (hello, select, replace-node-html), boundary (html exactly at 262144 bytes), and negative cases (over-limit, missing nodeId, unknown type, non-object). Gate-contract project added to playwright.config.js. Pure Node.js vm sandbox — no browser required. WO-08 / ADR-012 §2 / PAIN-MAP P0-13.
- Add test:gate-a11y: axe-playwright shell scan (3 workflow states, WCAG 2.1 AA). ADR-006 partial shipped. Known violations: color-contrast (#8a8a8e/#ffffff = 3.43:1) and nested-interactive (slide-item role=button with focusable descendants) — tracked in known-violations.md, marked test.fail() pending WO-10 remediation. Gate is additive — does not affect Gate-A baseline.
- keyboard-nav.spec.js: 6 keyboard navigation tests (P0-05, P0-08). Tab order through topbar → rail, Escape closes modal, ArrowDown/Up roving tabindex, Alt+ArrowDown reorders rail, modal focus-trap Tab/Shift+Tab, Russian aria-label invariant + --focus-ring-width token assertion. WO-10.

### Security
- Trust-Banner + neutralize-scripts one-click (AUDIT-D-01, ADR-014 §Layer 1, PAIN-MAP P0-01). `scanTrustSignals(doc)` detects `<script>`, inline `on*` handlers, `javascript:`/`vbscript:` hrefs, remote `<iframe>`, `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`, `<object>`/`<embed>` — scan-only, no DOM mutation. `TRUST_DETECTION_SELECTORS`, `TRUST_BANNER_CODE`, `TRUST_DECISION_KEYS` added to `constants.js`. `state.trustDecision/trustSignals/lastImportedRawHtml` slices added (reset to PENDING on every fresh import). After iframe `onload`, `maybeShowTrustBanner()` fires with 250ms defer; shows Russian-copy banner ("Презентация содержит исполняемый код (N элементов). Скрипты будут запущены.") with two actions: "Нейтрализовать скрипты" and "Оставить как есть". `neutralizeAndReload()` strips scripts/on*/javascript:/remote-iframes/meta-refresh/object/embed from a re-parsed copy of `lastImportedRawHtml`, rebuilds preview in `SANDBOX_MODES.SCRIPTS_ONLY` sandbox, toasts "Скрипты нейтрализованы. Превью пересобрано в режиме sandbox." `acceptTrustDecision()` clears banner, sets decision=accept, no re-fire for session import. NEUTRALIZE preserves style/class/id/data-* attributes — only on* stripped. Deck-script engine NOT blanket-stripped by default. 8-scenario test suite: trust-banner.spec.js. Gate-A: 59/5/0. ADR-014. P0-01.
- Shell banner plumbing + broken-asset recovery + sandbox-mode flag (AUDIT-D-01/07, P0-04). `shellBoundary.report/clear` API added to `feedback.js` (ADR-014 §Layer 1). `#shellBanner` region added to shell chrome (role=region, aria-live=polite, non-blocking). `SANDBOX_MODES` enum + `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_MODE='off'` added to `constants.js`; `state.sandboxMode` wired at `import.js:97` switch replacing bare `removeAttribute("sandbox")` with ADR-014/AUDIT-D-01/07 comment. `probeBrokenAssets` probes img/link/video/source via HEAD (localhost) or onerror-inspection (file://); result surfaces Russian banner "Некоторые ресурсы не найдены. N файл(ов)." with "Подключить папку ресурсов" action. New gate: `broken-asset-banner.spec.js` (4 scenarios). WO-07 will wire Trust-Banner script detection to SANDBOX_MODES.SCRIPTS_ONLY.
- Autosave size cap: warn at 3 MB, light-snapshot fallback at 6 MB, QuotaExceededError handled gracefully (AUDIT-D-05). stripHeavyDataUris strips only data:image/... URIs > 1024 chars; all HTML structure preserved. Russian toast copy surfaced at every tier; light-snapshot banner shown on restore. New gate: autosave-cap.spec.js (3 scenarios).
- Assert bridge postMessage origin in receive handlers (bridge.js shell + bridge-script.js iframe); replace bare `'*'` send target with origin-aware target — `file://` retains `'*'` (browser rejects `"null"` as target), `http(s)://` uses `location.origin`. New gate: `bridge-origin.spec.js` (2 scenarios + file:// note). Closes AUDIT-D-04. ADR-012 §4.
- Vendor pptxgenjs@3.12.0 under `editor/vendor/pptxgenjs/` to eliminate CDN supply-chain risk (AUDIT-D-03, P0-03). CDN path retained as operator opt-in with SRI `integrity` + `crossorigin="anonymous"` on the `<script>` element. Vendor path resolves under `file://` — no network required for default PPTX export flow. New gate: `export-sri.spec.js` (2 scenarios).
- `parseSingleRoot` now sanitizes tag allow-list (`ALLOWED_HTML_TAGS`), attribute filter (`BLOCKED_ATTR_NAMES` + `/^on/i`), URL protocol check (`javascript:`/`vbscript:`/`data:` non-image), `srcdoc` strip, and size guard (>256 KB rejected) in `replace-node-html` and `replace-slide-html` (AUDIT-D-02, P0-02). New gate: `bridge-sanitize.spec.js` (5 scenarios).
- Replace `Math.random` bridge token with `crypto.getRandomValues` (AUDIT-D-15, P1-15). Entropy upgraded from ~52 bits to 192 bits (24 bytes). Preserves `"pe-"` prefix for log-grep back-compat and `Math.random` fallback branch for sandboxed contexts without SubtleCrypto. New gate: `bridge-token.spec.js` (2 scenarios).

## 0.25.0 - click UX: layer picker for all modes + stack depth badge — 2026-04-20

### UX: Слои доступны всем, badge показывает прогресс cycling

Четыре изменения, которые завершают click-interaction ergonomics:

| Проблема | Решение |
|---|---|
| Layer picker только в advanced mode | Picker доступен в **всех** режимах |
| Кнопка «Следующий слой» не объяснит что делает | Единый текст «Выбрать слой» для всех режимов |
| Stack depth badge `X из N` никогда не показывался | Синхронизация `overlapCount` bridge → shell |
| Badge показывался бы сразу при 1-м клике (агрессивно) | Badge только при активном cycling (overlapIndex > 0) |

**Gate-A: 55 passed / 5 skipped / 0 failed ✓**

#### Технические детали
- `shell-overlays.js`: убрана проверка `complexityMode !== "advanced"` в `openLayerPickerForSelectedOverlap()`
- `dom.js`: кнопка `overlapSelectLayerBtn` всегда вызывает `openLayerPickerForSelectedOverlap()`
- `inspector-sync.js`: унифицированы текст кнопки и сообщение overlap banner (без mode-ternary)
- `bridge-script.js`: `postSelection` включает `overlapCount + overlapIndex` из `STATE.clickThroughState`; `updateClickThroughState` вызывается ДО `selectElement` в click handler
- `bridge-commands.js`: синхронизирует `state.clickThroughState` из `element-selected` payload (только при `overlapIndex > 0`)
- `state.js`: добавлено `clickThroughState: null` в shell state

---

## 0.24.0 - click interaction ergonomics — 2026-04-20

### UX: Click-to-edit без лишних движений

Четыре точечных изменения, которые делают редактирование интуитивным:

| Проблема | Решение |
|---|---|
| Случайные перетаскивания при клике | Drag threshold 4px → **6px** |
| Маленькие ручки resize — промахи | Selection handles 16px → **20px** |
| Микро-джиттер руки вызывал click-through | Proxy только при maxMovement < **2px** |
| «Стайл» клик-through после паузы | TTL **2000ms** только для shell proxy clicks |

**Gate-A: 55 passed / 5 skipped / 0 failed ✓**

#### Технические детали
- `constants.js`: `DIRECT_MANIP_THRESHOLD_PX` 4 → 6
- `overlay.css`: `.selection-handle` width/height 16px → 20px
- `selection.js`: отслеживание `maxMovement` в сессии манипуляции; `pendingOverlayClickProxy = maxMovement < 2`
- `bridge-script.js`: `trySelectFromClickThroughState(x, y, options)` — параметр `options.ttl`;
  TTL передаётся только из `proxy-select-at-point` (2000ms); прямые клики по iframe — без TTL (Infinity)

## 0.23.0 - layer separation: bridge-script, shell-overlays, boot extracted + v3 reference decks - 2026-04-16

### Разделение слоёв v2 — новые выделенные модули

Два оставшихся «толстых» файла разбиты по архитектурным слоям:

#### `preview.js` (4 275 строк) → 3 файла
| Файл | Строк | Слой | Содержание |
|------|------:|------|-----------|
| `bridge-script.js` | 3 424 | Bridge | `buildBridgeScript()` — самодостаточный мини-апп для iframe |
| `preview.js` | 34 | Rendering | `buildPreviewPackage()`, `injectBridge()` — только оркестрация |
| `bridge-commands.js` | 832 | Bridge | Обработчики `postMessage` из iframe (select, update, activate…) |

#### `inspector-sync.js` (4 156 строк) → 3 файла
| Файл | Строк | Слой | Содержание |
|------|------:|------|-----------|
| `inspector-sync.js` | 1 390 | View | `updateInspectorFromSelection()` — только чтение и синхронизация UI |
| `shell-overlays.js` | 818 | View | Модальные окна, палитра вставки, оверфлоу, выбор слоя, `setMode()` |
| `boot.js` | 1 962 | Bootstrap | `init()`, тема, все `bind*()` — единая точка входа приложения |

#### Итог: 25 JS-модулей, 18 288 строк кода
- Gate-A: **55 passed / 5 skipped / 0 failed**
- Скрипты `scripts/extract-layers-v2.js` и `scripts/extract-modules.js` повторяемы

### Тестирование реальных презентаций (v3 reference decks)

Добавлено 7 новых reference-deck кейсов в семейство `v3`:
- `v3-basic-minimal`, `v3-cards-columns`, `v3-tables-metrics`, `v3-visual-storytelling`, `v3-complex-stress`
- **`v3-prepodovai-pitch`** — питч ПреподовAI (Tailwind CDN, Google Fonts, animated slides)
- **`v3-selectios-pitch`** — питч SelectiOS (15 слайдов, тёмная тема, таблицы, absolute layout)

Все 7 прошли полный deep validation matrix (base, shell surfaces, text edit, slide structure,
table ops, drag/resize). Исправлен `verifyTableCapability` — теперь использует `finalizeEditCommit`
с многоуровневым fallback для JS-анимированных слайдов.

## 0.22.1 - HIG design pass (CSS polish) - 2026-04-16

### CSS de-indent + дизайн-токены
- **CSS de-indent**: все 8 файлов `editor/styles/*.css` очищены от 6-пробельного отступа HTML (`scripts/deindent-css.js`)
- **27 новых токенов** в `tokens.css`:
  - Spacing: `--space-1` (4px) → `--space-12` (48px)
  - Typography: `--text-2xs` (10px) → `--text-2xl` (22px)
  - Line-height: `--leading-tight` (1.2) → `--leading-loose` (1.7)
- **Font smoothing**: `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` + `line-height: var(--leading-normal)` в `base.css`
- **Inspector**: высота инпутов 28→30px, focus-visible кольца, `letter-spacing` подтянут, dashed→solid рамки
- **Overlays**: border-radius у пунктов контекстного меню, переходы для тостов
- Gate-A: 55/5/0 maintained

---

## 0.22.0 - architecture: split monolith into 8 CSS layers + 21 JS modules - 2026-04-16

### Архитектурный рефакторинг — разделение монолита

**Было:** единый файл `editor/presentation-editor.html` (~24 000 строк = CSS + HTML + JS в одном файле)
**Стало:** чёткое разделение по слоям — 1 HTML-шелл + 8 CSS-файлов + 21 JS-файл

#### CSS → `editor/styles/`
Все стили вынесены из `<style>` (было ~3 978 строк) в отдельные файлы по `@layer`:
| Файл | Слой | Содержание |
|------|------|------------|
| `tokens.css` | `tokens` | CSS-переменные, дизайн-токены, тема |
| `base.css` | `base` | Сброс, типографика, примитивы |
| `layout.css` | `layout` | Сетка шелла, панели, топбар |
| `preview.css` | `preview` | Превью-стейдж, рейл слайдов |
| `inspector.css` | `inspector` | Правая панель, формы, поля |
| `overlay.css` | `overlay` | Плавающий тулбар, контекстное меню, тосты |
| `modal.css` | `modal` | Модальные окна, шторки |
| `responsive.css` | `responsive` | Брейкпоинты, мобильные адаптации |

#### JS → `editor/src/`
Скрипт (~18 235 строк) разбит по ZONE-маркерам в 21 файл:
| Файл | Зона / содержание |
|------|------------------|
| `constants.js` | Константы, ключи хранилища, наборы тегов |
| `state.js` | SelectionPolicy + PreviewLifecycle + объект `state` |
| `onboarding.js` | Shell Onboarding — UI помощника |
| `dom.js` | Inspector Wiring — объект `els`, `cacheEls()` |
| `bridge.js` | Bridge Message Dispatch |
| `shortcuts.js` | Global Shortcuts & Window Events |
| `clipboard.js` | Clipboard & Drag-Drop |
| `import.js` | Document Loading & Import Pipeline |
| `slides.js` | Slide Registry & Navigation |
| `preview.js` | Preview Build & Bridge Bootstrap |
| `slide-rail.js` | Slide Rail Rendering |
| `style-app.js` | Style Application |
| `export.js` | Export & Assets |
| `history.js` | History: Undo / Redo |
| `feedback.js` | Feedback & Notifications |
| `selection.js` | Selection Overlay & Direct Manipulation |
| `toolbar.js` | Floating Toolbar |
| `context-menu.js` | Context Menu |
| `inspector-sync.js` | Inspector Sync (включает `function init()`) |
| `primary-action.js` | Primary Action Sync + autosave |
| `main.js` | Точка входа — вызывает `init()` последним |

#### HTML-шелл `editor/presentation-editor.html`
- Сжат с ~24 000 до **1 784 строк** (HTML-разметка + `<link>` + `<script src>`)
- Сохранён inline-скрипт темы (FOUC prevention)
- Порядок загрузки: 8 CSS-файлов → тело страницы → 21 JS-файл → `main.js`

### Архитектурные решения
- **Classic `<script src>` (не ES-модули)** — совместимость с `file://` в Chrome; все файлы делят глобальный скоуп
- **Вызов `init()` перенесён** в `main.js` (последний загружаемый файл); в оригинале он был посредине скрипта на строке ~6 722
- **Порядок CSS-слоёв** сохранён: декларация `@layer tokens, base, ...` в первом `tokens.css`

### Gate-A baseline
55 passed / 5 skipped / 0 failed — без регрессий

---

## 0.21.0 - design system polish: token consistency & dark-mode fixes - 2026-04-16

### CSS design system (Phase 5)
- **Hardcoded colors replaced** — все четыре вхождения `#8e8e93` заменены на `var(--shell-text-muted)`: `.topbar-eyebrow`, `.inspector-section h3`, `.section-toggle`, `.context-menu-section-title`
- **Dark-mode border bug fixed** — `rgba(29, 29, 31, 0.12)` заменены на `var(--shell-border-strong)` в трёх местах: `.slide-item::before`, `.layer-picker`, `.context-menu`; в тёмной теме эти бордеры теперь корректно отображаются белыми (не невидимыми)
- **Floating toolbar** — фон изменён с `var(--shell-field-bg)` на `var(--shell-panel-elevated)`, бордер — с `var(--shell-border)` на `var(--shell-border-strong)`; теперь панель визуально выделяется как плавающий попап, а не просто поле ввода
- **Align button active state** — `#ftAlignGroup button.is-active` теперь использует `var(--shell-accent-soft)` + `color: var(--shell-accent)` вместо плотного синего фона `var(--shell-accent)` — соответствует стилю `.toolbar-row button.is-active`
- **Token normalization** — `.floating-toolbar` и `.context-menu` используют `var(--radius-md)` вместо хардкода `12px`
- **`.section-toggle` cleanup** — удалено избыточное `color: inherit` (перекрывалось следующей `color:` декларацией)

### Git semver tags
- Применены теги `v0.20.0` – `v0.20.5` на исторические коммиты

## 0.20.5 - internal code structure: 21 navigable zone headers - 2026-04-16

### Внутренние улучшения (Phase 4)
- Добавлены **21 zone-header** с форматом `// ZONE: <Name>` по всему файлу `editor/presentation-editor.html` (~23 400 строк)
- Зоны: Selection Policy, Preview Lifecycle, Application State, Shell Onboarding, Inspector Wiring, Bridge Message Dispatch, Global Shortcuts & Window Events, Clipboard & Drag-Drop, Document Loading & Import Pipeline, Slide Registry & Navigation, Preview Build & Bridge Bootstrap, Slide Rail Rendering, Style Application, Export & Assets, History: Undo / Redo, Feedback & Notifications, Selection Overlay & Direct Manipulation, Floating Toolbar, Context Menu, Inspector Sync, Primary Action Sync
- Навигация по зонам: `grep "// ZONE:" editor/presentation-editor.html`
- Никакой рабочий код не изменён — только комментарии вставлены перед функциями

## 0.20.4 - element Ctrl+C/X/V, shortcut cheat-sheet modal - 2026-04-16

### Копирование, вырезание и вставка элементов
- **Ctrl+C** — копирует выбранный элемент во внутренний буфер (`state.copiedElementHtml`); `data-editor-node-id` у клона удаляются → пастированный элемент получает свежие ID
- **Ctrl+X** — вырезает: копирует в буфер и удаляет выбранный элемент
- **Ctrl+V** — вставляет элемент из буфера (после выбранного или в конец слайда); имеет приоритет над системным paste-ивентом
- Кнопки **«Копировать»** и **«Вставить»** добавлены в инспектор (секция «Частые действия»)
- Пункты **«Копировать», «Вырезать», «Вставить»** добавлены в контекстное меню; «Вырезать» видна при `canDelete`, «Вставить» — только при непустом буфере

### Справка по горячим клавишам
- Клавиша **`?`** открывает модальное окно со списком всех горячих клавиш
- Кнопка **«⌨ Справка»** в меню overflow топбара
- Модальное окно двухколоночное: «Редактирование текста», «Элементы» / «Навигация», «Вид и экспорт»
- `shortcutsModal` включён в обработчик Escape и backdrop-close

## 0.20.3 - inspector polish: opacity, border-radius, Shape insert - 2026-04-16

### Инспектор — новые поля оформления блока
- **Прозрачность (%)** (`opacityInput`): числовое поле 0–100; конвертируется в CSS `opacity` 0–1; синхронизируется с вычисленными стилями; пустое значение = непрозрачный (opacity 1)
- **Скругление углов** (`borderRadiusInput`): текстовое поле, принимает `8px`, `50%`, `4px 8px`; применяется через `applyStyle("borderRadius")`; синхронизируется с `borderRadius` computed-стилей
- Оба поля включаются/выключаются через `styleLocked`; сбрасываются при снятии выделения; присутствуют в обоих путях синхронизации (primary + legacy)

### Вставка — кнопка «Форма»
- Новая кнопка **Форма** (`addShapeBtn`) в секции «Вставка» рядом с «Текст», «Картинка», «Видео»
- Вставляет абсолютно позиционированный `div` 160×100 px с синим фоном и `border-radius:8px` — готовая база для кастомных блоков
- `addShapeBtn` привязана к `syncPrimaryActionUi` (disabled при отсутствии активного слайда)

## 0.20.2 - keyboard formatting shortcuts & UX fixes - 2026-04-16

### Keyboard shortcuts (новые)
- **Ctrl+B** — жирный для выбранного элемента (не в режиме ввода текста)
- **Ctrl+I** — курсив
- **Ctrl+U** — подчёркнутый
- **Ctrl+L** — выравнивание по левому краю
- **Ctrl+E** — выравнивание по центру
- **Ctrl+R** — выравнивание по правому краю
- Все шорткаты работают только в режиме `edit` при выбранном текстовом элементе; в режиме `text-edit` (contenteditable) браузер обрабатывает их нативно

### UX-исправления
- Align-кнопки в floating toolbar: заменены нечитаемые символы ⬡/≡/⬢ на ← / ↔ / →
- Align-кнопки в инспекторе: обновлены аналогично (были «Слева»/«Центр»/«Справа», стали ← / ↔ / →)
- Tooltips на B/I/U в инспекторе дополнены шорткатами (Ctrl+B/I/U)
- Tooltips на align-кнопках инспектора дополнены (Ctrl+L/E/R)

### Инспектор — новые поля типографики
- **Шрифт** (`inspectorFontFamilySelect`): 11 распространённых семейств, синхронизируется с выбранным элементом
- **Межстрочный интервал** (`inspectorLineHeightSelect`): 1.0–2.0, синхронизируется с `lineHeight` вычисленных стилей
- Размер шрифта в инспекторе расширен до 16 значений (10–96 px), синхронизирован с floating toolbar
- Все новые поля включаются/выключаются и сбрасываются вместе с остальными text-entity контролами

## 0.20.1 - PowerPoint-parity UX: rich-text toolbar & presentation mode - 2026-04-16

### Floating toolbar — полный набор форматирования текста
- **Подчёркивание** (`ftUnderlineBtn`): Ctrl+U-семантика, активное состояние синхронизировано с computed styles
- **Выравнивание текста** (`ftAlignLeftBtn/CenterBtn/RightBtn`): три кнопки L/C/R в отдельной группе `#ftAlignGroup`; active-state отражает реальный `textAlign` выбранного элемента
- **Шрифт** (`ftFontFamilySelect`): выпадающий список 11 распространённых семейств (Inter, Segoe UI, Arial, Georgia, Times New Roman, Courier New, Impact и др.)
- **Размер шрифта** расширен: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 96 px
- Все новые контролы disabled при отсутствии текстового элемента, скрыты для нетекстовых сущностей
- Оба пути синхронизации (primary + legacy) обновлены

### Режим презентации
- Кнопка **▶ Показать** в topbar (outlined accent): открывает чистый экспорт в новом окне, запрашивает fullscreen после загрузки
- Tooltip-подсказка «Нажми F11 для полного экрана» в toast-уведомлении
- Кнопка disabled при отсутствии загруженной презентации

### UX-polish
- Tooltips (`title=`) добавлены на все кнопки topbar: Открыть HTML, ▶ Показать, Экспорт HTML, Экспорт PPTX
- Кнопка «Экспорт PPTX» переоформлена в нейтральный стиль (border/ghost), «▶ Показать» — в accent-outlined

## 0.20.0 - PPTX export and PowerPoint-parity UX - 2026-04-16
- **Export PPTX**: added "Экспорт PPTX" button to the topbar (outlined accent style, next to "Экспорт HTML")
- PptxGenJS loaded lazily from CDN on first use — no npm runtime dependency added
- Slide dimensions auto-detected from CSS custom properties (`--slide-w`, `--slide-h`) or `.slide { width }` rules, defaulting to 1280×720
- Absolute-positioned elements mapped to PptxGenJS coordinates (left/top/width/height in % and px both supported)
- Text leaves extracted with font-size (px→pt), color, bold, italic, align; flow-layout fallback for non-positioned text
- Image elements with `data:` URIs or `https://` src included; relative URLs skipped gracefully
- Slide background color parsed from inline `background-color` / `background` with gradient/url stripping
- Export does not modify `modelDoc`, the iframe DOM, or the HTML export path
- `exportPptxBtn` wired into `syncPrimaryActionUi` — enabled/disabled in sync with `exportBtn`
- Renamed "Экспорт" button label to "Экспорт HTML" for disambiguation

## 0.19.6 - responsive shell sidebars and inspector quick actions - 2026-04-15
- widened the slide rail and inspector with responsive `clamp(...)` sizing so desktop and wide viewports allocate meaningful space to navigation and element properties
- added selection-aware quick actions to the selected-element summary card for common text, media, image-fit, duplicate, and precision-mode workflows without exposing advanced fields first
- aligned compact shell CSS with the 1024px JS breakpoint so tablet/mobile users keep one clear bottom-rail mode control instead of duplicate preview toggles
- refreshed Playwright visual baselines for the wider shell geometry and added regression coverage for responsive panel scaling plus quick inspector actions
- kept quick-action rendering DOM-safe by constructing buttons with `createElement` and `textContent` instead of injecting HTML strings

## 0.19.5 - pilot shell hardening, asset parity validation, and operator runbooks - 2026-04-15
- hardened the stable `editor/presentation-editor.html` pilot workflow with clearer shell state transitions, compact-safe actions, and release-ready editor entrypoint behavior
- strengthened export asset parity validation and Playwright coverage across desktop, wide, tablet, and compact shell profiles with updated visual baselines
- added shared local test-server configuration to reduce port conflicts and make Playwright validation runs more deterministic
- documented the pilot checklist, operator runbook, known limitations, and auditability notes for reviewers adopting the current editor workflow
- kept the active runtime path stable while synchronizing package metadata to `0.19.5`

## 0.19.4 - layer order truth, overlap picker readiness, and stage-o regression coverage - 2026-04-13
- fixed layer ordering truth in the stable runtime by sorting authored layers from inline `z-index` values even when `modelDoc` is detached from the live preview document
- fixed the advanced overlap recovery flow so `Magic Select` only becomes interactive after the layer picker payload is actually ready for the current overlap selection
- tightened `stage-o` regression coverage around sibling-scope reorder and normalize behavior, plus stabilized inline text editing assertions under the shell selection overlay
- kept the active editor runtime on the stable `editor/presentation-editor.html` entrypoint with no release-line fork or archived runtime promotion

## 0.19.3 - entrypoint simplification, support policy cleanup, and semver resync - 2026-04-10
- promoted the active runtime artifact to `editor/presentation-editor-v0.19.3.html` so the latest `main` state, package metadata, launchpad, shim, Playwright harness, and asset-parity tooling resolve to one semver runtime again
- archived the previous `0.19.2` runtime to `docs/history/presentation-editor-v0.19.2.html` and removed the root-level `editor/presentation-editor-v0.19.2.html` runtime from active use
- simplified the first-run repo entrypoint by removing the redundant `start:open` alias and keeping the root launchpad on a single obvious happy path
- demoted the compatibility redirect from a top-level launchpad CTA to low-noise metadata so first-time users are not asked to choose between equivalent-looking entrypoints
- corrected `SECURITY.md` support-line wording so the limited-support row no longer references a pre-release `0.19.2` adoption state that already happened

## 0.19.2 - onboarding entrypoint, ghcr path, security policy, and semver sync - 2026-04-10
- promoted the active runtime artifact to `editor/presentation-editor-v0.19.2.html` so the current tagged release, package metadata, docs, launchpad, and harness all resolve to one semver runtime again
- archived the previous `0.19.1` runtime to `docs/history/presentation-editor-v0.19.1.html` and removed the root-level `editor/presentation-editor-v0.19.1.html` runtime from active use
- added a human-first local repo entrypoint at `/` with `npm start`, sample-gallery links, and quick-start docs so a new user can run the application without discovering internal paths first
- documented GHCR as the supported GitHub Packages surface for this application and clarified the first-publish visibility step for public container pulls
- replaced the template `SECURITY.md` with a real security policy covering supported release lines, disclosure path, response targets, and supported reporting scope

## 0.19.1 - release hardening sync and proper semver patch tag - 2026-04-10
- promoted the active runtime artifact to `editor/presentation-editor-v0.19.1.html` so the shipped tag, package metadata, docs, harness, and compatibility shim all point at one normal semver release
- archived the previous `0.19.0` runtime to `docs/history/presentation-editor-v0.19.0.html` and removed the root-level `editor/presentation-editor-v0.19.0.html` runtime from active use
- refreshed project docs, local skills, and GitHub release artifacts to describe the proper `v0.19.1` patch release instead of the temporary non-semver hardening tag
- retained the `0.19.0` behavior contract: no bridge protocol changes, autosave stays on schema `v3`, export remains clean, and novice workflow remains `empty -> loaded-preview -> loaded-edit`

## 0.19.0 - honest feedback: block reason banners, stack depth badge, action hints - 2026-04-04
- **Block reason protocol (ADR-001)**: replaced boolean `hasBlockedDirectManipulationContext()` with `getBlockReason()` enum returning specific reason: `zoom`, `locked`, `own-transform`, `parent-transform`, `slide-transform`, `hidden`, or `none`
- **Block reason banner**: inline banner below selection overlay shows human-readable block reason with one-click resolution action:
  - "Масштаб ≠ 100%" → button "Сбросить масштаб" (resets zoom to 100%)
  - "🔒 Элемент заблокирован" → button "Разблокировать"
  - "Используется transform" → informational (use inspector)
  - "Элемент скрыт" → button "Показать"
  - Lock banner in advanced mode takes priority over block reason banner
- **Stack depth badge (ADR-002)**: `1/N` counter badge appears next to breadcrumbs when multiple candidates exist under cursor point, showing current position in click-through stack
- **Action-oriented summary copy**: `getSelectedElementSummary()` updated for all entity kinds to show actionable guidance ("Дважды кликните, чтобы начать печатать", "Можно перемещать и масштабировать мышкой") and surfaces block reason as primary feedback when manipulation is blocked
- **Playwright coverage**: new `honest-feedback.spec.js` (9 tests) covering block banner per reason, action resolution, lock priority, summary copy, stack badge, banner lifecycle, and export cleanliness
- **P2 zoning pass**: removed the late “v3 UX EXTENSIONS” override framing and re-labeled the runtime into explicit ownership bands for shell routing, selection/direct-manip feedback, history/autosave/export, and shell storage persistence
- **Honest storage/export cleanup**: replaced remaining silent shell-owned storage/export catches with diagnostics via `reportShellWarning(...)` for export URL cleanup, autosave clear/restore, copied-style persistence, selection-mode persistence, preview-zoom persistence, and theme preference loading
- **Clean export invariant**: export stripping now removes `data-editor-ui="true"` nodes before serialization and records any lingering editor-only residue in diagnostics instead of silently continuing
- All gates passed: Gate A (40/40), Gate B chromium-desktop (101/101), Gate B chromium-shell-1100 (51/51)

## 0.18.3 - zoom quality fix and layout optimization - 2026-04-03
- **Zoom quality fix**: Switched from `transform: scale()` to CSS `zoom:` property
  - CSS `zoom:` triggers browser re-layout at target resolution, preserving text and vector crispness
  - CSS `zoom` is on W3C standards track (Working Draft) with 97%+ global browser support
  - Eliminates blur/degradation artifacts at zoom levels < 100% ("мыльница" issue)
  - Simplified coordinate math: removed manual zoom multiplications from `toStageRect`, `toStageAxisValue`, `positionFloatingToolbar`
  - `getBoundingClientRect()` returns already-scaled values with zoom property; no manual scaling needed
  - Updated Playwright test to validate `zoom` property instead of `transform` matrix
  - **Browser requirements**: Firefox 126+ (May 2024), Chrome 4+, Safari 4+, Edge 12+; graceful degradation on older versions
- **Layout optimization**: Expanded preview panel as primary workspace
  - Reduced slides panel from `minmax(240px, 260px)` to `minmax(200px, 220px)` (40px narrower at max)
  - Reduced inspector panel from `minmax(256px, 280px)` to `minmax(220px, 240px)` (40px narrower at max)
  - Preview/edit panel now dominates screen space with ~80px more width on desktop
  - Side panels remain functional but visually subordinate to the main editing area
- All tests passing: shell.smoke zoom test validates quality-preserving scale behavior

## 0.18.2 - preview zoom control - 2026-04-03
- added zoom control to the preview/edit panel header with +/− buttons, percent label, and 1:1 reset button
- keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+= (zoom in), Ctrl+− (zoom out), Ctrl+0 (reset to 100%)
- zoom persists to localStorage across sessions (`presentation-editor:preview-zoom:v1`)
- zoom range: 25% to 200% with fixed steps (25%, 33%, 50%, 67%, 75%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%)
- iframe scales presentation content via `transform: scale(zoom)` + `width: calc(100% / zoom)` to prevent visual overflow
- coordinate system (toStageRect, toStageAxisValue, positionFloatingToolbar) accounts for zoom factor
- direct manipulation blocked when zoom ≠ 100% via shell-level check in hasBlockedDirectManipulationContext()
- widened main preview panel: workspace grid adjusted from `272-296px | 1fr | 288-312px` to `260-280px | 1fr | 272-296px` for 32px more preview width
- added Playwright smoke test "preview zoom controls change scale and persist @stage-f"
- all gates passed: shell.smoke (14/14), gate-b (143/143), asset-parity (4/4)

## 0.18.1 - release metadata, docs, agents, and semver runtime sync - 2026-04-03
- moved the active runtime artifact to `editor/presentation-editor-v0.18.1.html` and archived `editor/presentation-editor-v0.18.0.html` under `docs/history/`
- synchronized package version, Playwright harness targets, export-asset parity tooling, and shell smoke navigation with the active semver runtime filename
- updated source-of-truth docs, roadmap, testing strategy, release notes, and remaining-issues pointers to reflect the shipped `0.17.0` and `0.18.0` work
- refreshed local Copilot agents and skills so they read the current runtime path, release discipline, and validation expectations from the live repository state

## 0.18.0 - layers panel, lock system, visibility toggle, and grouping signed off - 2026-04-03
- added an advanced-mode layers panel for stack inspection, row-based reordering, lock state, visibility state, and direct selection sync
- added lock and unlock flows with deterministic lock-banner targeting to prevent accidental direct manipulation of protected elements
- added session-only visibility toggling so users can temporarily hide elements without polluting export output or authored markup
- added group and ungroup actions for advanced-mode multi-selection flows while preserving history safety and preview rebuild context
- added focused `stage-o-layers-lock-group.spec.js` coverage for selection sync, drag reorder, lock, visibility, grouping, and ungroup flows

## 0.17.0 - overlap recovery system signed off - 2026-04-03
- added overlap detection for severely covered elements using cross-frame-safe geometry and visual stack comparison
- surfaced overlap warnings in the shell so covered content can be discovered without raw DOM inspection
- added hover ghost highlighting and move-to-top recovery so hidden elements can be identified and raised safely
- added focused `overlap-recovery.spec.js` coverage for warning detection, hover feedback, and recovery action behavior

## 0.16.0 - click-through layer selection signed off - 2026-04-03
- added repeated plain-click layer cycling for overlapping elements so the
  selected overlay no longer blocks access to lower layers after the first
  selection
- routed shell overlay clicks and `Escape` through the bridge, keeping
  click-through, reset-to-topmost behavior, and selection focus consistent
  between iframe and shell-owned interaction paths
- added focused Playwright coverage for repeated click cycling, reset on a new
  point, `Escape` recovery, numbered layer context-menu items, layer pick from
  context menu, and export cleanliness
- fixed container mode state leak: switching selection modes now resets
  click-through cache to prevent stale candidate lists from interfering with
  fresh selections
- fixed modelDoc artifact leak: element-update bridge messages now strip
  transient iframe selection attributes before importing into modelDoc,
  preventing `data-editor-selected` from entering export output

## 0.13.14 - novice shell summary cards and CTA polish signed off - 2026-04-01
- promoted loaded preview into a clearer novice decision point with a visible
  primary `Начать редактирование` CTA instead of forcing the user to infer the
  next step from mode toggles alone
- turned the basic preview inspector into a real compact slide-summary path by
  showing summary context while hiding the full slide editor controls until the
  user explicitly enters edit mode
- turned the basic selected-element path into a friendlier summary-led card
  with human-readable type copy, while keeping raw node metadata and the `Тег`
  field advanced-only
- upgraded the onboarding and summary surfaces visually so the empty state,
  preview CTA, and novice inspector cards feel intentional rather than like
  leftover utility chrome

## 0.13.13 - novice-first shell workflow hardening signed off - 2026-04-01
- introduced the shell-owned workflow contract on
  `body[data-editor-workflow="empty|loaded-preview|loaded-edit"]` and now
  drive shell-panel visibility from workflow state instead of leaked
  disable-state chrome
- turned blank state into a single-path onboarding surface with one obvious
  `Open HTML` start action, a demoted `Paste HTML` path, and no pre-load
  inspector, slide rail, mode toggles, complexity toggles, or edit-only
  actions
- kept preview/edit architecture intact while making loaded preview clearly
  lead into editing by auto-activating the first slide, keeping the rail
  visible, and visually promoting `Edit` as the next action
- hardened basic mode so advanced inspector sections, HTML editors, raw
  attributes, and diagnostics are fully concealed instead of merely disabled,
  while loaded edit now resolves into a selection-first compact inspector path
- rewrote blocked-manipulation and open-modal shell copy into novice wording,
  simplified topbar command labels, and kept wide desktop free of horizontal
  overflow under the pruned empty-state chrome
- expanded `shell.smoke` and Playwright helper coverage for the novice
  empty/load/edit workflow, advanced reveal/conceal transitions, and updated
  topbar/basic-mode expectations
## 0.13.12 - topbar command fit hardening signed off - 2026-04-01
- kept desktop and intermediate topbar chrome inside the viewport by routing
  secondary commands through a button-owned overflow surface instead of
  letting the topbar action row squeeze the preview stage
- preserved the primary path by keeping `Open` and `Export` inline while
  `Theme`, `Undo`, and `Redo` move into overflow only when shell-owned width
  metrics say the inline command budget is exhausted
- extended transient-surface mutual exclusion so topbar overflow now closes
  cleanly against insert palette, context menu, and slide template surfaces
- added focused Playwright proof for the `chromium-shell-1100` intermediate
  topbar contract without changing the compact-shell breakpoint

## 0.13.11 - shell theme prepaint and surface ownership hardening - 2026-04-01
- moved shell theme resolution onto the document root before first paint, so
  dark preference no longer boots through a light-shell flash
- locked theme transitions during boot and explicit theme switches, which
  removed the temporary white segmented-control surfaces in dark mode
- normalized shell segmented controls to one button-owned surface per state
  instead of stacked nested layers, preserving the signed-off light visual
  contract while keeping dark mode stable
- kept Stage D and Stage F shell regressions green for immediate theme-safe
  segmented controls, ios-gamma desktop chrome, and transient surface routing

## 0.13.10 - editing ux hardening signed off - 2026-04-01
- unified shell and iframe text-edit ownership so space, enter, backspace,
  arrows, and regular typing stay inside the active editable context instead
  of leaking into slide navigation or shell shortcuts
- stopped aggressive blur teardown from kicking users out of inline editing
  when focus briefly moves through transient shell UI on the same selection
- tightened capability messaging so protected and direct-manipulation-blocked
  states explain the real restriction and keep inspector-based geometry edits
  available where they remain safe
- kept selection context menus compact on desktop and compact shells, and made
  floating toolbar and context menu mutually exclusive transient surfaces
- expanded Stage C through Stage F Playwright coverage for text-edit focus,
  blocked direct manipulation, compact context-menu geometry, theme-safe
  editing affordances, and the new visual context-menu baseline

## 0.13.9 - slide rail actions signed off - 2026-04-01
- added desktop slide-rail drag and drop reorder as the primary structural path
- added a unified slide context menu with duplicate, move, and delete actions
- kept compact widths on a simpler kebab-only slide action path instead of
  forcing drag interactions into narrow layouts
- verified Stage D rail reorder and slide-menu flows across the signed-off
  Chromium width set while preserving the green full suite

## 0.13.8 - direct manipulation shell hardening signed off - 2026-04-01
- kept direct manipulation honest by surfacing blocked-state feedback at the
  selection frame instead of silently failing
- clipped selection chrome to the visible preview viewport without clamping the
  underlying manipulated element geometry
- fixed compact routing so blocked element selections stay on the fast toolbar
  path instead of opening overlapping inspector chrome
- verified safe drag/resize plus blocked-tooltip flows across the signed-off
  Chromium width set

## 0.13.7 - regression baseline added - 2026-04-01
- added Stage C and Stage D Playwright regression proof for direct
  manipulation and slide-structure flows
- expanded shared browser helpers for slide-rail drag and slide-menu access
- established a red baseline before the direct-manipulation and slide-rail
  fixes were locked

## 0.13.6 - compact shell drawer hit-area proved - 2026-03-31
- narrowed the compact-shell backdrop to the visible dimmed area outside the
  active drawer, so close gestures stop landing on panel content at `390 / 640`
- promoted Stage E Playwright coverage from placeholder to active release gate
  for drawer close, hidden-panel inertness, and compact-shell geometry on the
  signed-off narrow widths
- kept the full active Playwright suite green after enabling the Stage E gate,
  raising the verified line to `73 passed / 31 skipped`

## 0.13.5 - connected asset diagnostics signed off - 2026-03-31
- promoted Stage D Playwright coverage from placeholder to active release gate
  for connected asset-directory diagnostics across the signed-off Chromium
  width set
- verified that diagnostics no longer collapse back to the previous false-clean
  zero summary once fixture assets are connected under the shared manual-base
  contract
- kept the full active Playwright suite green after enabling the Stage D gate,
  raising the verified line to `70 passed / 34 skipped`

## 0.13.4 - direct manipulation coordinate correctness proved - 2026-03-31
- widened the proven direct-manipulation envelope to nested positioned
  contexts by tracking `left/right` and `top/bottom` anchors explicitly instead
  of assuming one inset space
- preserved truthful blocking for unsafe transformed contexts, so keyboard
  nudge falls back to diagnostics instead of writing incorrect coordinates
- hardened selection sync around blur and bridge-driven element updates so
  non-text selection paths stop tearing down editing state unexpectedly
- promoted Stage C Playwright coverage for text edit, image replace,
  block/image/video/layout insertion, and safe-vs-unsafe keyboard nudge flows
- refreshed loaded-shell visual baselines to match the expanded Stage C
  fixture deck while keeping the full suite green

## 0.13.3 - deterministic slide activation proved - 2026-03-31
- promoted Stage B Playwright coverage from placeholder to release gate for
  create, duplicate, delete, undo/redo, and autosave-recovery flows across the
  signed-off Chromium width set
- added shell-aware browser helpers so compact-width regression scenarios use
  the real slide-list and inspector drawers instead of hidden desktop controls
- removed the timing hole where structural slide mutations relied on debounced
  history capture, making undo/redo deterministic under immediate
  create/duplicate/delete sequences
- captured structural slide history against the intended active slide target,
  not the stale runtime-confirmed slide, so restored drafts and undo states
  land on the correct slide index
- persisted editor mode through history snapshots and autosave payloads so
  undo, redo, and draft recovery return to the truthful `edit` state instead
  of silently dropping back to preview
- stopped runtime `bridge-sync` reconciliation from creating background history
  entries, which removed the redo-invalidating race after slide rebuilds and
  restores
- hardened cold-start Playwright navigation for the signed-off mobile width set
  so the Stage B gate does not fail on harness-only `page.goto` timeouts
- kept the full active Playwright suite green after enabling Stage B coverage
