# CHANGELOG

## 0.13.10 - editing ux hardening signed off - 2026-04-01
- unified shell and iframe text-edit ownership so space, enter, backspace,
  arrows, and regular typing stay inside the active editable context instead
  of leaking into slide navigation or shell shortcuts
- stopped aggressive blur teardown from kicking users out of inline editing
  when focus briefly moves through transient shell UI on the same selection
- tightened capability messaging so protected and direct-manipulation-blocked
  states explain the real restriction and keep inspector-based geometry edits
  available where they remain safe
- kept selection context menus compact on desktop and compact shells, and made
  floating toolbar and context menu mutually exclusive transient surfaces
- expanded Stage C through Stage F Playwright coverage for text-edit focus,
  blocked direct manipulation, compact context-menu geometry, theme-safe
  editing affordances, and the new visual context-menu baseline

## 0.13.9 - slide rail actions signed off - 2026-04-01
- added desktop slide-rail drag and drop reorder as the primary structural path
- added a unified slide context menu with duplicate, move, and delete actions
- kept compact widths on a simpler kebab-only slide action path instead of
  forcing drag interactions into narrow layouts
- verified Stage D rail reorder and slide-menu flows across the signed-off
  Chromium width set while preserving the green full suite

## 0.13.8 - direct manipulation shell hardening signed off - 2026-04-01
- kept direct manipulation honest by surfacing blocked-state feedback at the
  selection frame instead of silently failing
- clipped selection chrome to the visible preview viewport without clamping the
  underlying manipulated element geometry
- fixed compact routing so blocked element selections stay on the fast toolbar
  path instead of opening overlapping inspector chrome
- verified safe drag/resize plus blocked-tooltip flows across the signed-off
  Chromium width set

## 0.13.7 - regression baseline added - 2026-04-01
- added Stage C and Stage D Playwright regression proof for direct
  manipulation and slide-structure flows
- expanded shared browser helpers for slide-rail drag and slide-menu access
- established a red baseline before the direct-manipulation and slide-rail
  fixes were locked

## 0.13.6 - compact shell drawer hit-area proved - 2026-03-31
- narrowed the compact-shell backdrop to the visible dimmed area outside the
  active drawer, so close gestures stop landing on panel content at `390 / 640`
- promoted Stage E Playwright coverage from placeholder to active release gate
  for drawer close, hidden-panel inertness, and compact-shell geometry on the
  signed-off narrow widths
- kept the full active Playwright suite green after enabling the Stage E gate,
  raising the verified line to `73 passed / 31 skipped`

## 0.13.5 - connected asset diagnostics signed off - 2026-03-31
- promoted Stage D Playwright coverage from placeholder to active release gate
  for connected asset-directory diagnostics across the signed-off Chromium
  width set
- verified that diagnostics no longer collapse back to the previous false-clean
  zero summary once fixture assets are connected under the shared manual-base
  contract
- kept the full active Playwright suite green after enabling the Stage D gate,
  raising the verified line to `70 passed / 34 skipped`

## 0.13.4 - direct manipulation coordinate correctness proved - 2026-03-31
- widened the proven direct-manipulation envelope to nested positioned
  contexts by tracking `left/right` and `top/bottom` anchors explicitly instead
  of assuming one inset space
- preserved truthful blocking for unsafe transformed contexts, so keyboard
  nudge falls back to diagnostics instead of writing incorrect coordinates
- hardened selection sync around blur and bridge-driven element updates so
  non-text selection paths stop tearing down editing state unexpectedly
- promoted Stage C Playwright coverage for text edit, image replace,
  block/image/video/layout insertion, and safe-vs-unsafe keyboard nudge flows
- refreshed loaded-shell visual baselines to match the expanded Stage C
  fixture deck while keeping the full suite green

## 0.13.3 - deterministic slide activation proved - 2026-03-31
- promoted Stage B Playwright coverage from placeholder to release gate for
  create, duplicate, delete, undo/redo, and autosave-recovery flows across the
  signed-off Chromium width set
- added shell-aware browser helpers so compact-width regression scenarios use
  the real slide-list and inspector drawers instead of hidden desktop controls
- removed the timing hole where structural slide mutations relied on debounced
  history capture, making undo/redo deterministic under immediate
  create/duplicate/delete sequences
- captured structural slide history against the intended active slide target,
  not the stale runtime-confirmed slide, so restored drafts and undo states
  land on the correct slide index
- persisted editor mode through history snapshots and autosave payloads so
  undo, redo, and draft recovery return to the truthful `edit` state instead
  of silently dropping back to preview
- stopped runtime `bridge-sync` reconciliation from creating background history
  entries, which removed the redo-invalidating race after slide rebuilds and
  restores
- hardened cold-start Playwright navigation for the signed-off mobile width set
  so the Stage B gate does not fail on harness-only `page.goto` timeouts
- kept the full active Playwright suite green after enabling Stage B coverage
